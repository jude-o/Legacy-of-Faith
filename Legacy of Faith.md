Deuteronomy 7:9

Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations.
 
#Foreword


This book was prompted because of the discovery of many stories that were recorded by Samuel Huddleston, about the generations of Huddleston’s who lived in Cambridge City, Indiana. I had not done any actual research on the Huddleston line, and when I finally connected with the autobiography of Samuel Brown Huddleston and learned that he had also written a series of articles from his civil war journal that appeared in the New Castle Courier in 1871, it set me to the task of transcribing and printing this information for future generations so it would no longer be obscured, buried in disjointed newspaper accounts.

I enjoyed the organizing of this book so much I wished that I had another to do, but I did not know what or how to approach another one. I had collected and put into a file all the stories of the Huddleston family that Samuel had written about either from his research or from personal interviews. I kept them in this file, thinking to maybe publish them as a Huddleston Family Reader, but it was little more than bits and pieces of people’s lives and I wasn’t sure that anyone would be motivated to read just bits and pieces of people’s lives. But as the months wore on and this idea stayed in the back of my mind, another thought began to form as a result of inspiration from our LDS leaders. I felt inspired by their challenge to learn from our ancestors and record their faith promoting experiences for the next generation. This idea was the impetus for another book to organize!

#Why We Do Family History

Why not glean from these stories inspiration and faith that guided them through their trials and sorrow. This legacy of Faith could be organized and brought forward for the next generation of family members who are searching for something to believe and guide them through their current trials.	July 24th is a day we set aside each year to celebrate our Pioneer Heritage.	Elder Dallin Oaks helped me define the reason for
sharing these stories of our ancestors. “Now after all these studies and activities (24th of July Pioneer Day) it is appropriate to ask ourselves, “Therefore, what?” Are these pioneer celebrations academic, merely increasing our fund of experiences and knowledge? Or will they have a profound impact on how we live our lives?	This question applies to all of us.	As President Hinckley reminded us last April, “Whether you are among the posterity of the pioneers or whether you were baptized only yesterday, each is the beneficiary of their great undertaking.” All of us enjoy the blessings of their efforts, and all of us have the responsibilities which go with that heritage.	“It is not enough to study or re-enact the accomplishments of our pioneers. We need to identify the great, eternal principles they applied to achieve all they achieved for our benefit and then apply those principles to the challenges of our day. In that way we honor their pioneering efforts, and we also reaffirm our heritage and strengthen its capacity to bless our own posterity and “those millions of our Heavenly Father’s children who have yet to hear and accept the gospel of Jesus Christ.” We are all pioneers in doing so.”	Elder Dallin Oaks “Following the Pioneers” Ensign 1997 pg 72

Another man of faith, Elder Eyring, expressed a need to record these experiences for the next generation he shared his inspired thoughts at the November 2007 General Conference.

―When our children were very small, I started to write down a few things about what happened every day. Let me tell you how that got started. I came home late from a Church assignment. It was after dark. My father-in-law, who lived near us, surprised me as I walked toward the front door of my house. He was carrying a load of pipes over his shoulder, walking very fast and dressed in his work clothes. I knew that he had been building a system to pump water from a stream below us up to our property.

He smiled, spoke softly, and then rushed past me into the darkness to go on with his work. I took a few steps toward the house, thinking of what he was doing for us, and just as I got to the door, I heard in my mind—not in my own voice—these words: ―I’m not giving you these experiences for yourself. Write them down.‖

I went inside. I didn’t go to bed. Although I was tired, I took out some paper and began to write. And as I did, I understood the message I had heard in my mind. I was supposed to record for my children to read, someday in the future, how I had seen the hand of God blessing our family. Grandpa didn’t have to do what he was doing for us. He could have had someone else do it or not have done it at all. But he was serving us, his family, in the way covenant
 
disciples of Jesus Christ always do. I knew that was true. And so I wrote it down, so that my children could have the memory someday when they would need it.

I wrote down a few lines every day for years. I never missed a day no matter how tired I was or how early I would have to start the next day. Before I would write, I would ponder this question: ―Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?‖ As I kept at it, something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done.

More than gratitude began to grow in my heart. Testimony grew. I became ever more certain that our Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. I felt more gratitude for the softening and refining that come because of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ. And I grew more confident that the Holy Ghost can bring all things to our remembrance—even things we did not notice or pay attention to when they happened.

The years have gone by. My boys are grown men. And now and then one of them will surprise me by saying, ―Dad, I was reading in my copy of the journal about when …‖ and then he will tell me about how reading of what happened long ago helped him notice something God had done in his day.

My point is to urge you to find ways to recognize and remember God’s kindness. It will build our testimonies. You may not keep a journal. You may not share whatever record you keep with those you love and serve. But you and they will be blessed as you remember what the Lord has done. You remember that song we sometimes sing: ―Count your many blessings; name them one by one, And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.‖2

It won’t be easy to remember. Living as we do with a veil over our eyes, we cannot remember what it was like to be with our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, in the pre-mortal world; nor can we see with our physical eyes or with reason alone the hand of God in our lives. Seeing such things takes the Holy Ghost. And it is not easy to be worthy of the Holy Ghost’s companionship in a wicked world.

That is why forgetting God has been such a persistent problem among His children since the world began. Think of the times of Moses, when God provided manna and in miraculous and visible ways led and protected His children. Still, the prophet warned the people who had been so blessed, as prophets always have warned and always will: ―Take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life.‖3

And the challenge to remember has always been the hardest for those who are blessed abundantly. Those who are faithful to God are protected and prospered. That comes as the result of serving God and keeping His commandments. But with those blessings comes the temptation to forget their source. It is easy to begin to feel the blessings were granted not by a loving God on whom we depend but by our own powers. The prophets have repeated this lament over and over:

―And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.

―Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One—yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.‖

And the prophet goes on to say: ―Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths!‖4
 
Sadly, prosperity is not the only reason people forget God. It can also be hard to remember Him when our lives go badly. When we struggle, as so many do, in grinding poverty or when our enemies prevail against us or when sickness is not healed, the enemy of our souls can send his evil message that there is no God or that if He exists He does not care about us. Then it can be hard for the Holy Ghost to bring to our remembrance the lifetime of blessings the Lord has given us from our infancy and in the midst of our distress.

There is a simple cure for the terrible malady of forgetting God, His blessings, and His messages to us. Jesus Christ promised it to His disciples when He was about to be crucified, resurrected, and then taken away from them to ascend in glory to His Father. They were concerned to know how they would be able to endure when He was no longer with them.

Here is the promise. It was fulfilled for them then. It can be fulfilled for all of us now:

―These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.

―But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.‖5

The key to the remembering that brings and maintains testimony is receiving the Holy Ghost as a companion. It is the Holy Ghost who helps us see what God has done for us. It is the Holy Ghost who can help those we serve to see what God has done for them.

Heavenly Father has given a simple pattern for us to receive the Holy Ghost not once but continually in the tumult of our daily lives. The pattern is repeated in the sacramental prayer: We promise that we will always remember the Savior. We promise to take His name upon us. We promise to keep His commandments. And we are promised that if we do that, we will have His Spirit to be with us.6 Those promises work together in a wonderful way to strengthen our testimonies and in time, through the Atonement, to change our natures as we keep our part of the promise.

It is the Holy Ghost who testifies that Jesus Christ is the Beloved Son of a Heavenly Father who loves us and wants us to have eternal life with Him in families. With even the beginning of that testimony, we feel a desire to serve Him and to keep His commandments. When we persist in doing that, we receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost to give us power in our service. We come to see the hand of God more clearly, so clearly that in time we not only remember Him, but we come to love Him and, through the power of the Atonement, become more like Him.

You might ask, ―But how does this process get started in someone who knows nothing about God and claims no memory of spiritual experiences at all?‖ Everyone has had spiritual experiences that they may not have recognized. Every person, upon entering the world, is given the Spirit of Christ. How that spirit works is described in the book of

Moroni: ―For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.

―But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him. …

―Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a child of Christ.‖7

The Spirit of Christ has already, from their childhood, invited them to do good and warned them against evil. They have memories of those experiences even if they have not recognized their source. They will remember the feeling of joy or sorrow when they are taught the truths of the gospel. And that memory of the Spirit of Christ will soften their hearts to allow the Holy Ghost to testify to them.
 
I testify to you that the warm feelings you have had as you have listened to truth being spoken are from the Holy Ghost. The Savior, who promised that the Holy Ghost would come, is the beloved, glorified Son of our Heavenly Father.

Tonight, and tomorrow night, you might pray and ponder, asking the questions: Did God send a message that was just for me? Did I see His hand in my life or the lives of my children? I will do that. And then I will find a way to preserve that memory for the day that I, and those that I love, will need to remember how much God loves us and how much we need Him. I testify that He loves us and blesses us, more than most of us have yet recognized. I know that is true, and it brings me joy to remember Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.‖

#Preface

The following story was an article requested by Teresa Baer, Editor of “Indiana Connections” magazine after I submitted to her a transcript of the Civil War Journal of Samuel B. Huddleston, hoping they would be interested in publishing it.	The Indiana Historical Society was not interested in publishing the history but was most interested in how I obtained the records.	This was a significant article for me to write and also a catalyst for taking all of the family stories that Samuel had recorded and put them into this compilation.

Serendipity: The faculty or phenomenon of finding valuable or agreeable things not sought for.

In the companion book for the PBS series Ancestors: “In Search of our Ancestors” the author, Megan Smolenyak states that “If you were to gather fifty genealogists in a room, chances are that forty-five of them would readily admit to having experienced a few unexplainable incidents in their search for their roots.” Until Hank Z. Jones in his book “Psychic Roots” brought to light this common research experience of getting help from un-expected sources, many of these stories were not talked about so openly. In five video clip segments on www.rootstelevision.com Hank discusses that he was definitely not searching for his ancestors as much as his ancestors were “chasing him.”	Since there are as many stories as there are people researching their roots, and these stories are such an interesting phenomenon unique to doing family history work, ww.genealogytoday.com invites people to write their stories for submission to their website. These stories are awe-inspiring and encouraging for those who have not yet delved into discovering their family roots. I have had many of these types of experiences over the years but the serendipitous experiences that are directly related to my 2nd great grandfather Samuel Huddleston probably top any that I have had up to that point.

I struggled with the idea of going back east to Ohio for my husband’s family reunion in July of 2005. They were going to be camping out and I don’t care for camping. I have food allergies and it would be even more difficult to obtain the specialized food that I would need. The consequences of getting sick seemed too high a price to pay, so I decided a few months before the reunion that I would not go. However, this decision did not feel right. Whenever the subject came up several weeks later I again stated that I would not be going, only to feel afterwards that again this was not the right decision. I was not thinking about the opportunity to obtain more genealogy or family history, even though I would be an hour or so away from the cradle of my Mother’s family hometown and Quaker heritage. I focused only on my specific health challenges. My husband had made his flight reservations again questioning about my going and I said No. About a week fore the reunion, Nolan’s brother in-law, volunteered to pick me up if I had changed my mind. He was driving from California to Ohio with his youngest son. For some reason, I relented – or repented according to how you look at it and decided to go. Nolan’s family was wonderful and it turned out we had an air-conditioned cabin instead of a tent and so this was pleasant, but the food was still an issue and I struggled with feeling well.

Despite my struggle, I remembered that I had promised my niece, Brittany, that on my next trip back to Cincinnati, I would take her over to Cambridge City, Indiana and we would tour the Huddleston House
Museum.

The House had been built by John Huddleston, a Quaker, and great uncle of my mother’s. It was built on national road 40 and was the main thoroughfare for anyone traveling west in the middle 1800’s. This house had been obtained by the State of Indiana and is an historical site. So I dragged myself out of bed to what I considered a monumental effort to make good on my promise. I was glad after all, to have made the trip and toured the museum. It was good to see how this museum is utilized in the community. They teach people how to dip candles, have civil war re-enactments on the grounds and have Abe Lincoln address the troops during the enactments. They also do authentic harvest dinners. I was pleased to share our heritage with the next generation and realized the importance of having them connect with their ancestors.

I have an aunt and an uncle who live just a few miles from the museum and so Katie, Brittany and I drove there hoping they would be home, since no one had answered my call the night before. They had just arrived home from a camping trip so the timing was perfect. My aunt; who has been doing genealogy for thirty years or more and collected all things Huddleston and I immediately immersed ourselves in conversation about genealogy when she learned we had just come from the Huddleston House.

She said, “You have Samuel Huddleston’s autobiography don’t you?” I did not know it existed until that very moment. As she was copying this for me – about 80 pages worth, I mentioned that I would like to pay for the copies – but she refused any payment each time I tried. While we were having this conversation, the doorbell rang and a few moments later my uncle came into the room with a ream of paper. He said “their neighbor thought she might be in need of paper that day so she sent this over.” We both looked at each other and then acknowledged that this was definitely not a co-incidence. The value of coming on this trip was beginning to take on new meaning because of this incident. I have no doubt that I was there specifically to obtain this record. Samuel was somewhat prolific in his writings and he told some interesting details about his life as a youth, but what caught my attention was that he had kept a civil war journal and that it had been published in the New Castle Courier. I mentioned to my aunt that I would like a copy of it after I had returned home. True to her zealousness in obtaining all things Huddleston- she said no need to make a special trip to get that – she had it and when she had time, would copy it and send it to me.

I started learning digital Scrap-booking in 2006. I got Adobe Photoshop for Christmas and bought some CD’s that was very helpful in acquainting me with the program and how to do lots of fun things. One of the fun things I learned was how to take a photo and make it into a digital puzzle. As soon as I learned how to do this I awoke in the middle of the night with a thought of how to utilize this technique on a specific photo to promote the Family History fair that was coming up in October of 2006.

I was not a novice at organizing history fairs.	I had organized a family history fair in October of 2004 and had as a guest Colorado Governor Bill Owens. This had supercharged our event and we had a terrific turnout, so it was no surprise that 2 years later they would ask me to again be the Committee Chair person. We would not have a celebrity to supercharge our event this time and so I felt a need to advertise as much as possible to get as good a turnout.

With the lessons I had been taking in Adobe Photoshop I had also been able to restore a photo of my great grandparents, with my grandmother sitting on her mother’s lap. My aunt, who is an artist had used the original photo and graphed it off so she could draw a larger picture of my great grandmother. This might have been the end to the
only picture we have of her, if not for restoration help. I knew I wanted to use this photo, and perhaps a
 
document behind it as a graphic to advertise the family history fair. I tried several documents, until I finally remembered that the best choice would be the citizenship papers of Andrew Moore, who immigrated to Indiana in 1852 from Ireland. He is the father of Samuel, pictured in the photo. I made up the puzzle and printed the family history website and date on the graphic and started transferring this image to t-shirts and totes. I then gave everyone on the committee a t-shirt or tote and instructed each person to display them everywhere, hoping it would be a conversation starter and generate some interest in the fair. I started this campaign in May 2006.

I had not been actively engaged in doing research on any of my lines for a couple of years. 2005 had been an extremely active year with several events, births, deaths and a couple of funerals which kept us busy and out of town a lot. We ended the year with a move into a new house that needed a lot of work, so the articles of my great grandfather’s journal that my aunt sent me just before the move in November of 2005 were filed into a drawer until I had more time to savor them. One Sunday afternoon in September 2006 I went to lie down because I was not feeling well. While I was lying down, a thought came to me that I should do some research on the Craig family. This became more than just a thought it became a nagging feeling that weighed on me to the point that as soon as I started feeling better, I started researching on Ancestry.Com.

This family is another of my mother’s lines. I had spent considerable time in the past looking for this family in the census records. I had found Jesse & Rebecca Craig in the 1860 Census Wayne County, Indiana with just a couple of their children and the 1900 Wayne County Census, which listed a few grandchildren. We could never come up with a census showing all of their children. I knew Rebecca was a mother of 12 children, from the obituary that my Aunt Leah had sent me. She had also researched this line and together we had come up with bits and pieces of information. Each of the children that we did find stated in the census records that they had been born in Kentucky. I was not sure about this since I found their parents in the Indiana census records. I thought the family was still in Indiana during the 1870 & 1880 census and that the census pages for them was not readable, faded, or that the census taker had missed them. I finally stopped researching this line because I had exhausted all of my ideas of where this family might be located.

When I got this prompting to do some research, I was skeptical. I had been at a dead stop on finding this family. I did some research and gleaned a few tidbits on Jesse and Rebecca’s descendants. I stopped for a break. I went back later that afternoon and as I was researching a thought came into my mind to look in the 1870 Kentucky census record. As I watched the computer do its’ calculations I scanned the page looking for Jesse Craig.	I saw a Jesse Craig in Robertson County, Kentucky. My heart beat fast – Pearl Craig states on her marriage certificate that she was born in Robertson County, Kentucky. This had to be them! I quickly clicked to this page – There they were! Jesse, Rebecca, and five of their children! The exciting thing is that here were listed three of the children’s names that we did not have! I was overwhelmed! I could not believe it! I questioned whether I had ever looked for them in Kentucky – I must not have if they were so clearly found. I simply would not have gone looking for this family if I had not felt such a prompting.

I communicated my findings to my aunt Leah and she wrote back, ecstatic. She shared information with me about another daughter that she had identified through another obituary. Wow! Now I had four more children’s names – this made eleven of the twelve children that have been identified for Jesse & Rebecca Craig. This experience rejuvenated our efforts to continue to search on this line. I was thrilled to finally be piecing this family together. Doing family history work is like going on a treasure hunt and I certainly felt rewarded for my efforts. One day as I was reflecting on this event and how grateful I was for the help I had received in finding these children, a realization came to me. I grabbed my family history bag with the graphic on it and looked at it in amazement – The Grandparents that I had used on the graphic was Samuel & Orpha Craig Moore. Orpha is the daughter of Jessie Craig and Rebecca Mitchell! Could the fact that I had plastered this picture on tote bags and t-shirts and distributed it to dozens of people be the reason that I was urged to look for and find more of the Craig family? Is it possible that the more I learn about them, talk about them, encourage others to do their family history work the more help I get from unexpected sources? Later reflection also revealed that the day this prompting came was also Orphas’ birthdate. Was this another interesting co-incidence?
 
Again, I experienced an event that I had not personally been seeking. This experience spurred me on to retrieve the articles that I had placed in a file ten months before. I enthusiastically retrieved the journal and found that the articles were almost impossible to read because they had been reduced to fit on eight and a half by eleven pages. I felt a trip back to Indiana was needed to see if I could get better and more complete copies. I left two days after another successful family history fair and obtained the information I sought. Once I had read through the articles I realized that this information should not be obscured, but readily available to anyone doing research on this line. More importantly, I believed these articles should be made available for any descendants of the Indiana 84th Regiment, because this was not just a civil war journal of Samuel’s experiences, but a Regimental history. I made inquiry to the Indiana Historical Museum Press because I thought they might be interested in publishing this book because of the broader readership. I was
informed that the civil war market was flooded with stories and they were not interested. Self publishing this book for family members and donating copies to the Henry & Wayne County libraries as well as the Indiana Historical Museum and the Salt Lake City library would have to be sufficient. What the Indiana Historical Press was interested in, however, was an article for one of their magazines about how I was led to this journal.

This is now my third serendipitous experience with this ancestor. I made a trip that initially I did not want to make, that yielded the autobiography that a neighbor felt impressed to supply paper for -that mentions the journal, to an unusual 2nd experience that spurred me on to obtain the articles that brought about the book, that put me in touch with the Indiana Historical Museum who gave me an opportunity to tell many others about this Regimental History. None of this was anything that I was looking for or even remotely expected to happen, but certainly has become a valuable and pleasant experience for me. I am reminded of the movie “Field of Dreams” and the farmer who is convinced by a mysterious voice that he should build a baseball diamond and is told by the voice, “If you build it he will come.” My belief is that if we invest the time to find our ancestors and to honor their lives by bringing their stories to light, “they will come” to open doors that tell us the stories of their lives.

I ask of you dear reader if you now have any doubts that our ancestors wish for us to learn of them, to know their stories and to learn from their experiences?
 
#A Legacy of Faith

As I begin this journey back in time and history of our ancestors, I think it important to know their religious beliefs since this is the best way of measuring how they lived. This legacy of faith comes in large part because of our Quaker heritage. I found that besides the Huddleston’s there were two other Quaker lines, The Cox’s and Cadwallader’s that eventually marry into the Huddleston line as well as one Quaker line that ties into the Maloney line.

Leah Huddleston had provided a few photos of the Cox line and so I decided to focus on this line exclusively one day. After an all day search on the internet, I had been able to go back a couple of generations, identifying Martha Cox’s parents in the census records. When I took a break for dinner and enthusiastically shared my finds with Nolan, I was anxious to get back to see if I could find any more information on this family. What a delightful surprise to find exactly what I was looking for on “rootsweb” in the form of a Cox Family Bible.
This information took me back another generation. I was so delighted to get this info, that I quickly sent an e-mail of ecstatic thank you’s to the publisher. He was very kind to write back and say – Well. If you enjoyed that- wait till you see what else I have to send you . He promptly e-mailed several pages of information from “The Cox Family in America” which took the Cox line all the way back to the foundation of this country. The
Cox family had imigrated from England and settled in the Long Island or as it was called anciently Matinecock, Oyster Bay” area of New York. Because they were Quakers, information about birth, death, and marriages were recorded because of the inspiration that George Fox, their leader, received during an imprisonment for his beliefs. He received inspiration that meetings of “Friends” should also be recorded.

Our country was founded on religious freedom. Until Catholic teachings were challenged they dominated the beliefs of ancient people and the teachings of the Bible were taught by the priests who were educated to know and understand the workings and interpretations of God. Martin Luther was the first to challenge these teachings, and from that time forward many other people were also “enlightened” from their readings and understandings from their reading of the Bible. One of those enlightened individuals was George Fox, who formed the Quaker faith. “This Sect was not originally called Quakers but were known and referred to themselves as “Children of the Light or simply “Friends.” Persecutors called them Quakers in derision, but they accepted the name, believing that one should approach the Almighty with awe. George Fox, one of the founders of this sect attributed the name “Quaker” to a Justice Derby who used the term in 1650 when Fox bade him “Tremble at the word of the Lord.” The central teaching of the Quakers is that each person is enlightened by the divine Light of Christ. Quakers were able to gather people of diverse views who could agree on the basic belief of an inner light.”

Coming to this country to worship in whatever fashion you desired, was not an absolute guarantee, as there was extreme prejudice against some sects. The Quaker faith was one of them.


















 
##Flushing Remonstrance

http://www.bownehouse.org/flushing_remonstrance.htm




In 1656, Governor Peter Stuyvesant passed an Ordinance declaring that any person entertaining a Quaker Meeting House for a single night was to be fined, and that vessels bringing any Quaker into the province would be confiscated. Sentiment grew in Flushing to oppose this infringement upon the right to enjoy liberty of conscience as provided in the town charter. It was decided to send a remonstrance to the governor in protest of his action.

John Bowne was not a signer of the Remonstrance, but he must have surely agreed with his fellow Flushing residents who did. In 1662, he was arrested for out-rightly defying the governor's ban by allowing Quakers to worship in his home.

The original Remonstrance manuscript is kept in the Manuscripts and History Section of the New York State Library in Albany, where it was damaged in a 1911 fire in the Capitol archives. A 21st century rendering of the Remonstrance follows.

REMONSTRANCE

Of the Inhabitants of the Town of Flushing To Governor Stuyvesant
December 27, 1657

Right Honorable,


You have been pleased to send up unto us a certain prohibition or command that we should not receive or entertain any of those people called Quakers because they are supposed to be by some, seducers of the people. For our part we cannot condemn them in this case, neither can we stretch out our hands against them, to punish, banish or persucute them, for out of Christ god is a consuming fire, and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

We desire therefore in this case not to judge least we be judged, neither to condemn least we be condemned, but rather let every man stand and fall to his
 
own Master. Wee are bounde by the Law to doe good unto all men, especially to those of the household of faith. And though for the present we seem to be unsensible of the law and the Law giver, yet when death and the Law assault us, if wee have our advocate to seeke, who shall plead for us in this case of conscience betwixt god and our own souls; the power of this world can neither attack us, neither excuse us, for if God justifye who can condemn and if God condemn there is none can justifye.

And for those jealousies and suspicions which some have of them, that they are destructive unto Magistracy and Ministerye, that can not bee, for the magistarte hath the sword in his hand and the minister hath the sword in his hand, as witnesse those two great examples which all magistrates and ministers are to follow, Moses and Christ, whom god raised up maintained and defended against all the enemies both of flesh and spirit; and therefore that which is of God will stand, and that which is of man will come to nothing. And as the Lord hath taught Moses or the civil power to give an outward liberty in the state by the law written in his heart designed for the good of all, and can truly judge who is good, who is civil, who is true and who is false, and can pass definitive sentence of life or death against that man which rises up against the fundamental law of the States General; soe he hath made his ministers a savor of life unto life, and a savor of death unto death.

The law of love, peace and liberty in the states extending to Jews, Turks, and Egyptians, as they are considered the sonnes of Adam, which is the glory of the outward state of Holland, soe love, peace and liberty, extending to all in Christ Jesus, condemns hatred, war and bondage. And because our Saviour saith it is impossible but that offenses will come, but woe unto him by whom they cometh, our desire is not to offend one of his little ones, in whatsoever form, name or title hee appears in, whether Presbyterian, Independent, Baptist or Quaker, but shall be glad to see anything of God in any of them, desiring to doe unto all men as wee desire all men should doe unto us, which is the true law both of Church and State; for our Saviour saith this is the law and the prophets.

Therefore if any of these said persons come in love unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free egresse and regresse unto our Town, and houses, as God shall persuade our consciences. And in this we are true subjects both of Church and State, for we are bounde by the law of God and man to doe good unto all men and evil to noe man. And this is according to the patent and charter of our Towne, given unto us in the name of the States General, which we are not willing to infringe, and violate, but shall houlde to our patent anmd shall remaine, your humble servants, the inhabitants of Vlishing.

The following story is an example of how this “freedom” had to be won even in this land. John Bowne’s story is taken from the “Cox Family in America “ Allied families Appendix pgs 282-84 written and researched by Henry Miller Cox. The Cox line is traced through Edith Cadwallader Huddleston – later Summerfruit, who’s mother was Martha Cox and father was Isaac Cadwallader, these ancestors were also from descendant Quaker lines. The story of John Bowne is widely known and the home where he worshiped according to his faith has been turned into a museum and still stands in Queens, New York. More information about this house and John Bowne can be found at this internet site http://www.bownehouse.org/ .

John married twice into our Quaker lines. He married first Hanna Feake, daughter of John Feke and Elizabeth Prior and then married James Cox’s daughter, Mary Cox. So he would be a great uncle – on two different occasions.

##John Bowne


John Bowne was born Matlock, Derbyshire, England, 9th of Third Month(? Mar. or May 1627 and baptized in Matlock Parish Church 29th same month, son of Thomas Bowne, baptized there May 25, 1595.	Thomas Bowne with his children John and Dorothy came to New England in the latter part of 1648 or early in 1649. In October 1650, John, leaving behind his father and sister, returned to England, and again arrived in Boston in May 1651.	In June of the same year he visited Flushing, L.I. in company with his brother in-law, Edward Farrington, who had married his sister, Dorothy, probably during his absence in England) and seems to have been much pleased with the place, as he removed thither shortly after to live.

On the 7th of May, 1656, he married Hannah Feake, b(supposed) at Watertown, Mass;, and about 1637 and after living for a time at Greenwhich, Conn., and New London, came to Flushing, with her mother, brothers, and sister, before 1649.	She was daughter of Lieutenant Robert Feake and Elizabeth (Fone) Winthrop, his wife.

John Bowne was at this time in the 29th year of his age and his worth and personal attractions were such as to elicit the favorable notice and commendation of Capt. John Underhill, then living at Southold, L.I., who writing from that place under date of April 12, 1656, to John Winthrop Jr., at Pequot, (New London), thus acquaints him with the new engagement; "Sir, I was latli at Flushing.	Hannah Feke is to be married to a verri jentiel young man of gud abilliti, of lovli fetture and gud behafior." As Hannah had made the acquaintance of some of the Friends who were holding meetings for worship in the woods, she soon became a member; and her husband, as he himself relates, on occasion going out of curiosity to look at them when assembled together, was so powerfully affected by the beauty and simplicity of their worship that he invited them to hold their meetings for the future at his house. It was not long before he joined them himself, not merely, as he states, from kindness and affection to his wife, but his judgment was convinced of the truth of the principles they held forth. Meetings had not long been held at John Bowne's house before complaints were made "by the Magistrates of Flushing Aug. 24, 1663 that many of the inhabitants are followers of the Quakers who hold their meetings at the house of John Bownne." An ordinance of the West India Company of 1662 provided that "besides the Reformed religion no conventicles should be holden in houses, barns, ships,
woods or fields, under the penalty of fifty guilders for the first offence, double for the second and arbitrary correction for every other."

Under the authority of this ordinance we find that great numbers, including many women, suffered severely both by direct action of the Governor, and his courts had at Gravesend. John Bowne was arrested, ninth month 1st 1662, charged with "harboring Quakers and permitting them to hold meetings at his house." He was then taken a prisoner to Fort Amsterdam, and on the 14th of the same month, the "court held by the Lords, Director General and Council at Fort Amsterdam in the Netherland" entered the following judgment:

"Because John Bowne, at present prisoner, dwelling at Flushing upon Long Island, has made no scrupple in vilipendation of the orders and mandates of the Director General and Council of the New Netherland, we do in justice to the high and mighty states of the United Provinces and the administrators of the West India Company of the Chamber of Amsterdam having heard the demand of the substitutes, and the acknowledgement of the prisoner, have condemned and do condemn the said John Bowne by these present boete (penalty)-5 and 20 pounds Flemish with the charges of the Justician, and with express admonition and interdict to abstain from all such forementioned meetings and conventicles, or else for the second boete, he be condemned in a double boete, and for the third boete to be banished out of this province of New Netherland." John Bowne refused to pay the fine, and was then confined in a dungeon and restricted to bread and water, no person whatever being allowed to speak with him. As this did not change his steadfastness of purpose he was sometime afterward taken to the Stadthause and put in the prison there, and allowed to see his wife and other friends. He was then notified that the Court had resolved that he must pay the fine that had been imposed or be sent out of the country; or he would be set free if he would promise to leave the country
 
in three months. He still remained firm in his purpose not to compromise his principles in any way. On Tenth mo.21st he was permitted to visit his friends under a promise to return in three days, and on the 31stof that month he was put on board ship and sent a prisoner to Holland. He arrived at Amsterdam on the 29th of Second mo. 1663.

The following statement was forwarded by the authorities of New Netherlands to the West India Company; "Honorable, Right Respectable Gentlemen. We omitted in our general letter the trouble and difficulties which we and many of our good inhabitants have since sometimes met with, and daily are renewed by the sect called Quakers, chiefly in the county and principally in the English villages, establishing forbidden conventicles and frequenting these against our public placards, and disturbing in a manner the public peace, in so far that several of our magistrates and well affectioned subjects remonstrated and complained to us from time to time of their insufferable obstinacy, unwilling to obey our orders or judgment.	Among other has one of their principle leaders named John Bowne, who for his transgressions was, in conformity to the placards, condemned to an amends of 150 Guilders in suevant, who has been now under arrest more than three months for his unwillingness to pay, obstinately persisting in his refusal, in which he still continues, so that we at last resolved, or were rather compelled to transport him in this ship from this province in the hope that others by it be discouraged. If nevertheless, by these means no more salutary impression made upon others we shall, though against our inclinations be compelled to prosecute such persons in a more severe manner, and which we previously solicit to be favored with your "Honour's wise and forseeing judgement. With which after our cordial salutations we recommend your Honours to God's protection, and remain, Honourable and Right Respectable Gentemen, your Honour's faithful servants."

The officials of the West India Company considered the case and drew up a paper for John Bowne to sign.	In reply he sent to the Company the following dignified statement: "Friends, the paper drawn up for me to subscribe I have perused and weighed, and do find the same not according to that engagement to me through one of your members, viz: that he or you would do therein by me as you would be done unto, and not otherwise. For which of you being taken from your wife and family, without just cause, would be bound from returning to them unless upon terms to act contrary to your conscience, and deny your faith and religion, yet this in effect do you require of me and not less.

But truly, I cannot think that you did in sober earnest ever think I would subscribe to any such thing, it being the very thing for which I rather chose freely to suffer want of the company of my dear wife and children, imprisonment of my person, the ruin of my estate in my absence there, and the loss of my goods here, than to yield or consent to such an unreasonable thing as you thereby enjoin me unto. For which I am persuaded you will not only be judged in the sight of God, but by good and godly men, rather to have mocked at the oppressions of the oppressed and added afflictions to the afflicted than herein to have done to me as you in the like case would be done unto, which the royal cause of our God requires. I have with patience and moderation waited several weeks expecting justice from you, but behold an addition to my oppression in the measure I receive. Wherefore I have this now to request for you, that the Lord will not lay this to your charge, but to give eyes to see and hearts to do justice, that you may find mercy with the Lord in the day of judgment.

In the Fourth mo. John Bowne was released. He returned to America by the way of England and the Island of Barbadoes, but did not reach Flushing until first mo. 30th, 1664. The authorities in Amsterdam sent to the officials in New Netherlands the following decision, dated Amsterdam, April 16, 1663: "We, finally, did see from your last letter, that you had exiled and transported hither a certain Quaker named John Bowne, and although it is our cordial desire that similar and other sectarians might not be found there, yet as the contrary seems to be the case, we doubt very much if rigourous proceedings against them ought not to be discontinued except you intend to destroy your population, which however, in the youth of your existence, ought rather to be encouraged by all possible means.

Wherefore, it is our opinion that some connivance would be useful that the consciences of men, at least, ought ever to remain free and unshackled. Let everyone be unmolested as long as he is modest as long as he does not disturb others or oppose the government. This maxim of moderation has always been the guide of the magistrates of this city, and the consequence has been that from every land people have flocked to this asylum.	Tread thus in their steps and we doubt not you will be blessed.
 
(Signed) The directors of the West India Company Amsterdam Department Abraham Wilmandonk
David Von Baerle"

This document has peculiar historic interest because of the fact that it was one of the first official proclamations of religious liberty for any part of America, the establishment of religious liberty in Maryland by Lord Baltimore, (a catholic) having antedated it. With this decree the persecution of Friends on Long Island ceased.

While in Holland John Bowne wrote letters to his wife and numbers of Friends, which are still preserved. They are remarkable for the illustrations they give of unflinching steadfastness of purpose, for the beautiful and lofty ideas expressed in them, and for their elegant and sometimes scholarly diction. In one of these he said: "Dear George Fox and many more Friends desire their love and tender salutations remembered to all Friends." From this we may infer that he was visited at Amsterdam by George Fox and others.

Hannah, wife of John Bowne, became more and more zealous in religious devotion and having "received a gift in the ministry," she, in earlier part of the year 1675, left her home to pay a religious visit to Friends in Great Britain. The letters of her husband sent to her there are admirable in their expression of tender affection of interest in her religious service. In one of these he quaintly remarks: "Dear heart, to particularize all that desire to be remembered to thee would be exceedingly large, but this I may say for all Friends in general, relations and neighbors, and people, the like largeness of love for one particular person I have seldom found amongst them, as it is for thee."

He joined his wife in her religious service in England in the year 1676 and accompanied her through England and Holland. Returning to London at the beginning of winter of 1677 she was taken sick with a fatal fever and died at the house of their friends, John and Mary Elson, at the Peel Meeting Place, in St. John Street, London, on the 31st of Eleventh Month (Jan.) 1677-8

John Bowne took with him on this journey the following minute of approval. "In the Men's and Women's Meeting on Long Island in America. These are to certify to all whom it may concern that our dear and well beloved Friend, John Bowne, of Flushing (his occasion at this time requiring his being in Ould England by the first conveyance) is for his life and conversation un-blamable and of good report, and is likewise in true love and unity with all Friends in the truth here, as by large experience we have all found and witnessed." (Signed by many Friends)

"John Bowne dyed the 20 day of the 10 month in the year 1695 and was buryed ye 23 day of the same being about 68 years of age he did Feely Expose himself his house and Estate to ye service of Truth and had a constant Meeting In his house near about forty years he also suffered very much for ye truths seak."

He was thrice married. His second wife was Hannmah Bickerstaff who brought a certificate from Tupton in Derbyshire, England. They m. 1679 He m. 3rd 26/4 mo. June 1693 Mary Cock. Mary Cock was daughter of James Cox & Sarah Clarke, of our ancestral lineage.

##Katherine Chatham

(Huddleston Family Tables)
Our Great Grandmother, Katherine Chatham was also persecuted for her Quaker beliefs. The following is information is taken from the Huddleston Family tables and was researched by Samuel and his cousin, George Huddleston about Catherine and Valentine Huddleston.

“Yet a word or two of Katherine Chatham of whom I have made mention in the margin of what hath been said before. She came from London through many trials and hard travels to Boston and appeared clothed with sackcloth as a sign of the indignation of the Lord coming upon you in the weight and sense of which she came there and appeared for which instead of coming to a sense of your condition and what was coming upon you in the burden of which she came so far and through such hardship. You laid hand upon her and put her in prison out of which you would give no deliverance until with the seven and twenty aforesaid you drove her out with sword and club into the wilderness and that was the reward you gave her for her love in coming so amongst you.	And such was your rage and cruelty to her that at Dudham she was not only whipped but the man that was with her and traveled together though you had little to say to him. After this she coming to Boston again you imprisoned her a long season there to pay a fine you laid upon her thinking to be rid of her that way in cold winter and sad extremities and sickness near to death but the Lord otherwise provided for her and disappointed you for she was took to wife by John Chamberlaine and so became an inhabitant of Boston.”

Valentine Huddleston immigrated to Maryland about 1633. He had numerous transactions in land on Patuxent River, in Calvert County, Maryland, between that date and 1671, when he is believed to have migrated to Newport, R.I., about the time of his marriage to Katherine Chatham. He was living at Newport at the time of the birth of his sons, Henry in 1673 and George in 1677-see "Savage's Dictionary of First Settlers", V. 2, p.487.

He was one of the 56 persons to whom on 06 Nov 1684, William Bradford and associates conveyed lands which included the present site of New Bedford (Dartmouth), Mass., which they had previously purchased from the Indians. Upon division, each purchaser received 800 acres. Valentine Huddleston lived and died there, as did several generations of his descendants. Notes: Katherine Chatham was the widow of John Chamberlain, by whom she had Henry, b. 1659; William, b. 1661; Susannah, b. 1664; Peleg, b. 1666; Jane, b. 1667. Her sons lived in Monmouth, N.J. beginning about 1680.- "Historical Misc.", by Stillwell, 248; 3 ib. pgs. 158-161. Catherine also had 5 of John Chamberlains children from his previous marriage to Mary brown in Bucks Co. Pa. John Chamberlain was originally from Burlington Co. New Jersey.

With Catherine’s children by John, (4) and John’s 5 children with Mary Brown, Valentine would have instantly had a large family, the addition of his own three made 11 children that Valentine helped to raise.


See N.E. Historical Genealogical Register, V. 20. Valentine Huddleston was born in 1628 and died in 1727 and married Katherine (Chatham) Chamberlain. Children of Valentine and Katherine (Chatham) Huddleston were: Henry born 1673 and married Sarah Case, George born 1677 and married Mary Case and Katherine who married Joseph Collins in 1698. Notes: George Huddleston was living in Dartmouth, Mass on 15 Dec. 1715, on which date his father Valentine Huddleston deeded him part of his original "800 acres" for the settling of his son George for the future. Sarah and Mary (Case) Huddleston were daughters of James Case, and witnessed a deed in 1719. Mary was wife of George and he and Henry having married sisters. Children of George and Mary (Case) Huddleston were: Isaac, who married Eleanor Mortimer and Richard, who married Sarah Tallman.

Valentine Huddleston's son George, with his family, appeared to have disappeared out of Massachusetts about 1730. It is possible that they may have found a group or groups in other colonies. Henry's descendants are scattered through the States. A large group of them now reside in Eastern Indiana. The 1790 Census shows Peleg, with a family of 3 males and 3 females, in Bristol County, Mass and Seth in Guilford County, N.C.
No research has been done on Seth’s father Seth Huddleston and his mother Elizabeth Fish.
 

There is a Huddleston Family Association on the internet and you can find out more information, research, etc on this site: http://www.huddleston.bravepages.com.
 
##Seth Huddleston

(as written by Samuel Huddleston)


The year 1776 was one of struggle, not only for the life of a new born Nation, but it was a year of struggle against starvation with almost everybody in New England. The people were taxed to their utmost to provide for the army, and especially was it hard for the Quakers and Tories to make a living. These two classes, though their sympathies were entirely unlike, were classed together, and the Revolutionists were against them with more bitterness and hatred than they felt toward the English in arms. The Tories of Revolutionary times were those who favored England against the Colonies, and the anti-war Quakers were generally desirous of freedom and independence but opposed to war. But, as already stated, this difference was not noticed by the Revolutionists, and they did all they could to force them to help carry on the war by taking from them everything that the army could use. In those days the butchers, on account of the scarcity of meat and money, sold “Soup Privileges/” that is, they came around with their beef wagon or cart twice a week, and the people knowing just when to expect them would have a kettle of water boiling over a hot fire. The butcher sold them the privilege of boiling a certain amount and quality of meat five, ten, or fifteen minutes, according to the number of pennies they could pay. When the privilege thus sold was fulfilled the butcher would take his meat out of the kettle, leaving nothing but the soup, and placing it again in his wagon he would hurry away to the next customer, who would be anxiously awaiting his coming. A few families that were more prosperous got the meat after the substance had been all boiled out of it. Other provisions were as scarce and hard to get as meat, but Seth Huddlestone and his wife struggled on, and in the course of a few years they became prosperous farmers, and in 1781 they bought the entire farm of their uncle, Benjamin Gifford, and the deed, of which the following is a certified copy, is on record in Bristol County, Massachusetts, book 65, page 105, and it has never been transferred from him.

We do not know whether the Abiel Gifford mentioned in the above deed was Seth Huddleston’s father-in-law or whether that is a mispell for Abigal. It is possible that Abiel was Lydia’s father, and her mother’s name was not Abigal. We will make an effort to find out from the county records the truth of these names and will publish the result in the future. Seth Huddlestone did not live in Massachusetts many years after he came in possession of this farm, but we do not know the exact date of his removal. John J. Nelson, present Clerk of the Superior Court of Guilford County, North Carolina, writes from Greensboro, June 26, 1891, in reply to our inquiry concerning his farm in that county: “I find on record a deed from George Mendenhall to Seth Huddlestone, February 5, 1788.” We think it is almost certain that he settled in the vicinity of this farm which was in Deep River Settlement at what was known as William Beard’s Hatter Shop, not many months and perhaps only a few days before he made this purchase.

We also know that he did serve in the Revolutionary War from these records that Leah Huddleston obtained. Huddleston,Seth:	Descriptive list of men mustered in Bristol County, Mass. By James Leonard Muster Master to serve in the Continental Army for the term 9 months from the time of their arrival at Springfield, dated Oct 29, 1779:13 co. Col. Hathaway’s regt.: age 33 yrs; stature 5 ft.6 in; complexion, dark; hair, black; eyes dark; engaged for town of Dartmouth.

When Seth Huddlestone moved from Massachusetts to North Carolina he believed that human slavery would soon expire of its own self, and it was this general belief among the Quakers that caused them to settle so thickly in Guilford and Randolph counties in North Carolina; but when they saw slavery growing stronger, and when they had become convinced that there was, and would be for years to come, a slave-owning and slave-trading South, and a freedom-loving North, the Quakers of North Carolina began to emigrate to the wilderness of the Northwest. But before Seth Huddleston could make the transition from North Carolina to regions farther north he died of typhoid fever September 7, 1791, aged 48 years, 3 months, and 26 days.

And as to my worldly estate wherewith it hath pleased God to bless me within this life.

##Johnathan Huddleston

(written by Samuel Huddleston)


Jonathan Huddlestone, the only son of Seth, was born in Massachusetts October 22, 1778. His sister, Levinah, said to the writer once when in conversation upon the subject of his name, that she knew that he was named for his uncle, Jonathan Fisher, whom they all loved, and not for his uncle, Jonathan Huddlestone, of whom they knew almost nothing.

His school privileges were inferior to those of his father, for the comparatively new settlement in North Carolina was almost without schools, and the children were mostly taught at home or not at all. He was but sixteen years old at his father’s death, and
being left in charge of the farm, he had but little time or opportunity to read and write.
Before Jonathan Huddlestone was twenty-one years old he gave notice to the Quaker church to which he belonged that he and Phebe, daughter of Eliab Gardner, a member of the same church, wished to marry. In accordance with the custom of the church, after the matter had been published during a number of Monthly Meetings, and had been acted upon by the members of said Monthly Meeting, the marriage was solemnized. When Seth Huddlestone moved from Massachusetts to North Carolina he believed that human slavery would soon expire of its own self, and it was this general belief among the Quakers that caused them to settle so thickly in Guilford and Randolph counties in North Carolina; but when they saw slavery growing stronger, and when they had become convinced that there was, and would be for years to come, a slave-owning and slave-trading South, and a freedom-loving North, the Quakers of North Carolina began to emigrate to the wilderness of the Northwest.

The Huddlestone homestead was sold in the spring of 1815, and by the middle of June, Jonathan Huddlestone had settled up his business and equipped himself for the journey to Indiana. He loaded his effects into a four-wheeled wagon and a two-wheeled cart, and with his mother, his wife and eight children, started upon their long and tedious journey. The four-wheeled wagon was drawn by three horses and the cart by one, and besides these they started with an old mare that was a family pet, but the journey was too much for her and she died on the way.
 
A number of their relatives had already settled in what is now Union county, Indiana, and among them was Jonathan’s father-in-law, Eliab Gardner, and several of his brothers-in-law, and it was in this settlement, four miles Southeast of the present site of Liberty, that Jonathan Huddlestone settled. About this time he dropped the final “e” from his name, as some of his children that are still living remember.

Not many days after the arrival of the Huddleston family, Jonathan got word that his sister, Rachel, and her family, were in trouble, and he started immediately on foot to return to her assistance. This trip necessitated an absence of several weeks, and his wife with five sons and three daughters, ranging from fifteen years old down to the cradle, had a hard struggle in the meanwhile. While he was gone, she, with the aid of their children, cut the timber, built a cabin, dug a well, and guarded their stock against the ravages of wild beasts. Though she had a father and brothers in the settlement she got but little help from them or any one else except to raise the cabin. They all had all the work they could manage at their own home.

When Jonathan Huddleston returned in November he brought with him his sister, Rachel, and her children, and was greatly surprised to find the improvements that his wife had made, for he had expected her to live in the wagon and tent until he should return and build the cabin. As soon as ground enough was cleared Jonathan began fruit tree culture and perhaps all the old orchards in Union county and adjoining country, were of trees selected from his nursery. In 1816 he brought a stock of goods from Cincinnati and opened a store and sold everything that was usually kept and sold in a store in those days, except whisky, tobacco, and goods that were produced from slave labor. He was the most radical and conscientious anti-slavery, anti-whisky, anti-tobacco Quaker in his settlement, and was from and after his settlement in Indiana, the keeper of a station on the “Underground Railroad,” an organized system for running fugitive slaves from the South into Canada.

At one time he was harboring two slaves when their masters came and demanded their property and succeeded in capturing one of the slaves. Jonathan forced them to go through a course of law in Liberty in order to prove their property, which they did, before they were allowed to take the Negro back into bondage. But the other Negro was kept hid away in the forest and fed by Jonathan until the slave-hunters had left the country, and he was never caught.

Jonathan Huddleston traveled the states over in his anti-slavery work and spoke and paid money liberally, and wrote extensively in a number of anti-slavery newspapers and published tracts of his own. He also published a book on theology, which, although it was a grand good book, it had one fault of dealing in personalities of an abusive character, which caused its quiet suppression by his friends.


The following is an article that appeared in the Anti-Slavery Newspaper in 1854 which shows the character of Johnnathan Huddleston as a man who was not afraid to take others to task for not adhering to their religious beliefs. The following was researched by Leah Huddleston


##The Anti-Slavery Bugle
SALEM, OHIO AUGUST 5, 1854

Johnathan Huddleston in sending his subscription for the Bugle, says: The question often rises in my mind what shall we do-what shall we do to be saved?"	Well I remember of reading or hearing somehow of "no cross, no crown," and I often think whether the time is not come, or coming, when we had better believe in and go to living out that doctrine.	I also remember hearing or reading in some old book that "without sacrifice there is not remission of sin." whether had we not yet better make the sacrifice of abstaining from purchasing the slave labor produce and set about it at once with a zeal and devoiton commensurate with our professing doing as we ??? strengthening and building up the slave holder that way and the many other ways, that they will soon become as strong the way we go on as to make slaves (it appears) of us all.	It has at length become very evident that they want to do it. Why? Preserve us Lord from evil should we pray.	Yet, willfully pursue the evil way." Perhaps this almighty dollar or dime, or even a cent is the difficulty, even those of the "religious" society of friends, (as they are so careful to designate themselves) some of them will enquire the difference in the price between slave or free produce and being told that a yard of factory, or a pound of coffee or sugar from the slaves' labor can be afforded one cent cheaper, he will reply "Ah, the poor slave, I pity his hard case, but I know how I come by my money I must make it go as far as I can- I must take the cheapest." Now this man virtually acknowledges that he himself does not consider his religion worth one cent--that he would not give one cent for it.	But to the glory of that society, let me here say that I have heard of one of their members who has said that he would go twice as far and pay twice as much and take that which was not half so good, before he would thus sustain slavery, now if all of that society were thus devout-thus sacrificing, it would have (I believe) a powerful effect towards breaking up slavery in this nation. There is a certain writer now in this nation; he is a man of great travel-great observation and information, who has said that the Methodist society are numerous enough of themselves to destroy this great evil by abstaining from the slave produce.	We have said above that "without sacrifice there is no remission of sins," and I have thought of late, if this is not the very sacrifice we have yet got to make, and whether we shall ever be able to journey forward till we do it; the children of Israel it seems could not journey forward till they had sacrificed the wedge of gold.	I think I have been told that the people of old England in their struggle against this kind of an evil, could not get forward much till some three hundred thousand	(if I mistake not) united all at one time and made the sacrifice of abstaining from the slave made sugar, soon after that I think we are told their way was opened to go forward. Now since all other ways and attempts to "save the Union", it appears have failed and for aught we know will fall, and whereas so many wise and thinking men see so clearly that this way would save us, and it being so completely in our reach, let us take right hold of it in earnest, why will we not take warning from the fate of cities and nations who have gone before us?"

Jonathan Huddleston was also opposed to war, or the settlement of strife and contentions by the force of arms. It was the custom in the early days of our state to compel every able-bodied man to meet at stated times and places to muster and drill in the arts of war, and those who would not muster were compelled to pay fines. The Quakers objected to paying fines for this offence, because the money that was thus collected was used to equip and pay the expenses of the muster. On this account the officers adopted the custom of taking property, such as log-chains, axes, or tools of any kind, or small stock or grain, or produce of whatever kind they could find, which, in their judgment was worth the amount of the fine, and the Quakers had to submit peacefully to this procedure until Jonathan Huddleston raised his voice in protest against the legality of the practice, and against their power to force a muster at all. He challenged their managing officer to meet him at the court house in Liberty, and discuss the matter of their differences before an arbitrating jury, chosen and agreed to by themselves jointly, and then abide by the decision. The agreement was fully entered into and all the preliminaries arranged, and upon the day set, Jonathan went with his books and papers, and his man hired to read for him, for he was a poor reader and could not read in public. The jury was in its place and all were ready, but there was not a mustering officer to be seen and they let the case go by default, and there never was a muster fine collected or a muster in Eastern Indiana afterward.

Johnathan owned a large farm in Union county and was a great lover of farm horses and kept from forty to fifty head. He made frequent trips to Cincinnati, driving stock to market and trading for himself and neighbors.

He was a most liberal supporter of all moral and religious reforms. As a Quaker he gave largely to the support of his church until the time of the split in that body, at which time he withdrew from it and never belonged to church afterward, although he worked and wrote as energetically as ever for religious and moral reforms.
In the preface of his book he said; My aim is to oppose oppression with an honest frown, till vice shrinks back though seated on a throne.” After receiving a number of extracts from church creeds, which to him were objectionable, he writes a creed of his own, which he insists should bind no one but himself, since every man ought to be free to adopt a creed of his own.

Condensed from an incomplete page

“I believe that when a person comes to see the corruptions of sectarianism, and has honesty enough to raise his voice against them, it is high time for him to prepare his heart for trouble.
“I believe in the Scriptures of Truth, without feeling myself found to place any implicit faith on any man’s explanation of them, for which I should doubtless be honored with martyrdom did I not live in a government
that restrains that frenzied zeal which would reduce a man’s bones to ashes for the illumination of his
understanding. “

On New Year’s day, 1837, after he had sold his farm and stock in Union county, Jonathan Huddleston moved to Dublin, a new town that had been laid out six years before in the wild forest near the western border of Wayne county. His children had mostly settled here previously and others followed afterward. Here he took an active part in incorporating the town and was leader in all the early public improvements. Especially was he an active factor in erecting the first high school building here and the schools thus inaugurated placed Dublin early at the head of the state as an educational village, which position she has ever continued to
hold. His old daybooks show that he handled the school and other public money for many years.
 
He was a Vice President of the National Liberty Convention, which met in Buffalo, New York, October 20, 1817*, and nominated John P. Hale for President, and Leicester King for Vice President of the United
States. He walked to and from this convention, as was his mode of travel on all journeys, long or short. At a
state convention, fifty years ago, a meeting was called in the afternoon for public speech making, and many grand speeches were made by the best men, not only of Indiana, but from other states, who were there, so said our informant. Jonathan Huddleston had sat quiet during the meeting, until near its close, when the President said: “Friend Huddleston, we would like to hear from thee—what has thee been doing lately?”	“I have been ding all the good I could find to do and as little harm as I could possible avoid,” he said, and sat down. Our informant said: “Of all the good and grand speeches I heard that day, fifty years ago, I cannot now remember one word that was said by any but Jonathan Huddleston, and I distinctly remember his whole speech,” so we see that a few simple words spoken to the point are more impressive than long and flowery speeches.

As fast as his children became of age and settled down to do for themselves he gave them two or three acres of ground and a little money to build a house, or to those who did not desire the ground he gave its value in money instead, and after they were thus provided for he spent his money liberally for the charities, until, when he died, he had barely enough left to pay his funeral expenses, which were as small as could be made, according to his wish.	He died January 16, 1866, aged 87 years, 2 months and 25 days.	His wife died July 18, 1860, aged 80 years, 8 months and 15 days.

The census records that I researched show that Johnathan and Phoebe were living apart in 1860. It is possible that because of Johnathan’s pious ways and demanding nature that she had enough and decided to live in peace before she died. This same personality will manifest itself in a future descendant with the same consequences.

* I have not been able to verify this time period, Samuel may have been confused about his local and national affiliation.	Searching the records that are held in Detroit for the National Liberty Convention does not verify this statement.

HUDDLESTON FARMHOUSE

JOHN HUDDLESTON

The Huddleston house has prominence in Cambridge City Indiana and is an historical landmark. I decided to include information about this house and it’s builder, John Huddleston, son of Johnathan & Phebe Huddleston. Even though we are not direct descendants of John. He is uncle to Samuel, who wrote this article.	It is important to have information about him and his family as this home is a living memory of our Huddleston heritage.

It seems to us that not many pioneers have lived in western Wayne County that have left more enduring and beneficial footprints behind them than John Huddleston; footprints that will reflect their sterling character far into the future to all lovers of local developments. He was born of Quaker parents, Johnathan and Phebe Huddleston. December 10, 1907 at Beard's Hatter Shop North Carolina and in 1815 his parents brought him to Union County Indiana. He was one of eight sons and five daughters, all of whom save one son, located in Dublin after their maturity. In the
early days of no railroads and difficult means of travel families clung closer together than they do now.

On March 4th 1830 at the age of 22 years John Huddleston married Susan, daughter of Abram Moyer, in the home of her parents four miles east of Liberty. They kept house in this settlement until 1835, when they moved to the new town of Dublin, and that same year they bought a seventy acre farm on the south side of the National Road a half mile east of Dublin. Cambridge City had not been laid out until the year following.
There had been but little clearing done on this farm and no building at all. The National Road had just been surveyed and travel did not follow the line of the survey in all places until the grading was done upon it.
Lick-branch, the little creek on the north side of the road hugged the high land bank coming close up to the present homestead. A little lower down the creek crossed the roadway and passed through; what is now John
Martin's garden and his front yard.

John Huddleston graded down the hill where he made his wagon and built his barn and filled up the bed of the creek ? its course to the north side of the road. He also graded the road from the top of the hill at the east end of the town of Dublin to the top of Limekiln Hill at the west end of Cambridge City. He used a homemade two-wheeled scraper for moving much of the dirt, with a heavy yoke of oxen at the wheels and a horse at the end of the tongue. Two of his sons, Levi and Henry drove the lead horse and helped drive the oxen. John, however, had to oversee the management of the oxen.

His first building was a little cabin scarcely high enough for a man to stand erect in, and it stood near the barn. There was a loft in the cabin for the children to sleep in and he used to “toss them up and help them down,” too and from their humble bed chamber. Later he built a hewed log house southwest of the present woodhouse, where the family lived only a few years; until he built his large brick house, which, after his death, became the house of his son Henry, and he in turn sold the farm to his son Charles, who occupies it at the present time (1911). When John Huddleston moved into his brick house he gave the hewed log house to
 
Jack Barns, a popular Negro, who tore it down and moved it to his lot on the south side of Cumberland Street at the east end of Dublin, where it stood a number of years and was displaced by a good frame house that is now owned by his daughter, Sarah.

In 1844 John Huddleston hired a brick molder and made the brick for his new house. He tempered the mud and wheeled it to the moulder, and Levi and Henry off bore the brick when they were only ten and eleven years old.	The brick were ? and burned on the ground near the house. The front rooms of the building were three stories high, the basement room's being under ground except in front. The two stories above contained the living rooms, the backyard being level with the floor of the second story. There are stone stairways outside on the east and the west ends of the house, leading down to the road. There are fourteen rooms in the house, and it took one hundred perch of stone to lay the basement walls that were underground, and the foundations of the back rooms. There are one hundred and twenty-five thousand bricks in the walls. The stone was quarried on the Henley farm about one mile south of John Huddleston's. The quarry had been exhausted long ago. Aaron Burr Smith laid all the stone and brick walls in this house. Afterward Smith became a “tinsman” and ran a tin shop and stove store in the building now occupied by E.J. Huddleston's tin shop and residence.


William Perry of Cambridge City took the lumber from the saw mill and dressed it by hand and put it into the building with no help except that of his own half grown boy, and the little help John Huddleston gave him in handling the heavy joists. A man who's name we have lost plastered the entire house for a horse valued at one hundred and twenty five dollars.

 







ORIGINAL FURNISHINGS OF JOHN & SUSANNAH HUDDLESTON
 
The barn was not a large one, but it was so conveniently arranged that it held a large quantity of feed above and twenty seven stalls for horses in the basement. Duets from the hay mow and corncrib brought the feed to the aisle between the two rows of stalls. There was ample room in the wagon yard and stable for the accommodation of the general travelers and movers, but the hundreds of emigrants that were pouring into western Indiana and Illinois from the time these building were erected until 1853 sometimes overtaxed, all the premises. Often more than one hundred moving families passed westward in a single day, besides the great number of freight wagoners, stages, horseback riders, and home teams that were upon the road.	Often mover's would pass in a continuous train of wagons as much as a mile long. A few times from twenty to forty families stopped at Huddleston's overnight, filling the wagon yard and roadsides near by with their wagons. John
Huddleston did not keep a tavern, but he sold feed for the horses and oxen that passed. He also sold food for families to prepare for themselves and he sometimes fed people at his table. In crowded times, and in bad weather the people were given sleeping rooms in the basement rooms, on the floor of the wide, long porch on the south side of the house and sometimes they were crowded to the barn floor. Many people who had good rain proof wagon covers slept in their own wagons from choice, even in bad weather.

In 1847 or near that time, many Mormons were moving westward, and one evening about twenty five families drove into the Huddleston wagon yard and put in for the night. When John and his boys came in from their work he presented his bill for the accommodations. The leader of the Mormons told him that the “Lord would pay him.” “Yes, said John Huddleston, “but you are the treasurer, and I do business for cash.” He received the “cash.”

John Huddleston did teaming between Dublin and Cincinnati, hauling produce down and bringing merchandise back, but he would not haul intoxicating liquors, tobacco, nor goods that had been made by slave labor.	At one time he hauled several thousand pounds of salted pork from the Dublin Market House that stood in the middle of Dublin Street in front of where the Methodist Parsonage now stands, to Cincinnati.
 
There were some deer, wild turkeys, and an occasional bear in these parts after John Huddleston settled here. One time Johan and his wife were feeding their hogs in a lot a little way south of their cabin, and a large brown bear came suddenly upon them and threatened to attack them paying little attention, at first tot their large and savage dog that hesitated to engage in the battle, but he came to the defense of this master and mistress and soon drove the beast to seek refuge in a retreat. When he endeavored to climb over the high rail fence the dog caught his hind legs and by the rolling off of the top rail, the bear was pulled back a few times but he finally escaped for the present but a stranger shot him a few miles away.

Before John Huddleston commenced to build he dug a well forty-eight feet deep, about twenty feet south of the house. It gave satisfaction for a short time, but being a deep well it became foul. Then he undertook to dig one after another closer to the house and failed on three of them each one being forty-eight feet deep and abandoned on account of caving. He had just reached the surface when the last one caved in. Then he commenced his fifth well near the door west of the kitchen. When he was down sixty three feet in this effort he was in hard-span and the digging was so hard he came out and welded a two inch auger onto a six foot shank and the next morning he bored three feet with it when the auger dropped through into water. By quick and hard work he was successful in driving a plug, wrapped with old cloths, into the hole and thus he stopped the flow of water until he walled the well up a little more than half way before night. Then he drew the plug, and the next morning the water was three feet above the top of the wall. They drew the water with their windless bucket until they could resume walling. When it was completed the water raised until they could dip it out with tin cups. He now dug a ditch and laid a wooden pump-log from the well to the road side and had a continuous flow of water from a standpipe into a trough where thousands of horses quenched their thirst when passing by; and a tin cup hung upon the standpipe for passing people to drink. He had risked his life, and came near loosing it in his long, hard, and discouraging toil in digging these five wells agrigating two hundred and fifty eight feet, but now his jeopardy and toil was forgotten in the joy the splendid reward, but this bounteous flow of water did not continue always, for about 1853, when the Indiana Central Railroad cut was made through the farm a few rods south of the well it must have tapped the fountain head, when water flowed out there.

John Huddleston helped to push forward many public enterprises, but he was not always successful in reaping personal benefits in cash profits. He took stock in the Whitewater Canal and the stock soon became worthless. When the Wayne County turnpike Company was granted the ownership of that portion of the National Road that lays within the county he became a stock holder in that Company, and helped gravel it in 1850. About the same time he took tow thousand dollars worth of stock in the Indiana Central Railroad Company and
helped make the grade between Cambridge City and Dublin. Both of these investments proved to be profitable. Some years later he sold his sock in both of these companies on purpose to help promote the Connersville and New Castle Junction Railroad which was graded and most of the bridges were built passed only a few rods in front of his house, but the company became insolvent and he lost all of his investment.

As before noted, John Huddleston was born a Quaker, but he became more liberal than his Church and attended other Church services and finally he sang in the Methodist meetings in Dublin, for which he was
 
dis-owned by the Quaker Church. This act so offended his sense of justice- and his understanding of true religion that he became an adherent of the then new craze of Spiritualism, and he became so enured in it that he commenced to write a new Bible, with what he termed “more liberal, and up to date doctrines.” He retained as much of the old Bible as he endorsed and revised, changed, left out, and added too, as his imaginary spirit tutors inspired him. But his after- thought showed that he had acted with immature consideration, for by the time he had studied the old Bible well enough to make the changes he had desired to make, and when he had almost completed his new Bible, in a volume of foolscap paper nearly a foot thick he and his noble wife came under conviction. The hand of god rested upon them for a few weeks until their friends and neighbors not understanding the meaning of the spell; had grave apprehensions of the seriousness of their affliction. But John and his wife were fighting their battles without the help of man, and when; at last they had enjoyed their modest shouts of victory together their friends recognized them as new creatures with perfectly balanced mental powers. They were baptized and joined the United Brethren Church, and in time he became a local preacher. They were both loved by the Church and were highly respected by all that knew them. John Huddleston's children say that their father's new bible was never seen, nor heard of after he was converted.

In August 1877, John Huddleston was attending the horses in the stable just after two strange mules had been led past and old and perfectly gentle family hose when it kicked him so severely that he had to be helped to the house where he laid in severe pain until he died.



 
 
JESSE HUDDLESTON

Written by his son Samuel

Jesse Huddleston & Edith Brown went into housekeeping in a neat little four roomed cottage that he had just built on a three acre tract of land his father had given him and where he had already commenced to establish himself in the fruit tree nursery business from which nearly all the early orchards and the general nursery stock of this pioneer section were started. Not long after his marriage Jesse Huddleston, full of enterprise and ambition for large success sold out in Dublin and located on the north side of the new National Road west of Cambridge City on land that is now occupied with buildings of the M.E. Parsonage, the residence of Frazier the green house of Mr. Thomas Peat and other residences in Cambridge city.

“In February 1851 my father, having so failed in his health that he could do but little hard work sold out his home and nursery land in Cambridge City, and having already reduced his stock he removed what he had left on hand to rented ground adjoining his residence home, just bought in Dublin and moved to it.	Before our removal to Dublin my father had been a frequent attendant at the services of the United Brethren Church in Dublin and I often accompanied him. After locating there, and I being about eight years old I remember distinctly the time and circumstances of my father's coming home from church one day and telling Mother he had been converted and had joined the United Brethren Church. Mother was very much displeased, and she believed it was her duty to let him know it. She was very careful and did all she could to watch me and my brother Martin after this time and prevented Father from reading the Bible to us and from talking to us about God and religion to us, for she had an ambition to make Calvinists out of her children but she was wholely unable to teach. She was uneducated and not apt as a
teacher. My father was an apt teacher and being now full of the Christian spirit and believing the end of his life was drawing near he embraced every opportunity he could get to teach us the Bible and the orthodox religion.	My father's health continued to fail until he died July 25th 1855, aged 43 years, 4 months, and 18
days. Mother’s age was nearly 31 years at this time and she had six children living. I being the oldest and was a little past twelve years old, and her baby girl was not born until two and a half months after her fathers’
death.”

##Autobiography of Samuel Huddleston


Do I know myself? Perhaps I do not; but I do know more about myself than anybody knows about me. Who, more than I, knows of my trials in childhood; my disappointments in youth; my failures and successes in manhood? Who but myself, has felt the blood flow quick in my veins when I have resolved that I would stand firm for what I believed was right, or die in it’s defense? Who but I could know what it cost me, sometimes to say with a positive determination that

'Trouble's darkest hour Shall never make me cower; To the Scepter's power Never! Never!! Never!!!


Who, more than I has felt shame and remorse when I knew I had erred or committed actual sin; and when in the face of all my moral purposes, I
have found that error and sin were so apt to beguile me? Who, but I having hated sin and loved rightewousness from my childhood, and having boasted in my youth and more mature manhood that I had the ability to resist temptations, has felt my humiliation when I have found that my self-sufficiency has, many times, been utter helplessness? Who but my self, has felt my emotions of joy when, after I had followed after teachers of error, or suggestions of evil inclination or of satan, and feeling the remose of smitten conscience have felt the terror of my self accusation? Or who more than I have felt the approvoal of a righteous pride when I have remembered my good and worthy acts; my service for my Country upon the battlefield, in the camps and as a nurse in the hospital?

After I have calmly considered all this, who, more than I, is able to write a true story of my life in a manner that will be pleasing and instructive to my children, or to whom-so-ever may care to read? Shall I cower or shrink from what I feel I ought to do because sane self imposed judge may wrongly criticize my purpose, or my effort?

I do not intend that this shall be a religious treaties. I shall only refer to matters of a religious character only as they must be woven in order to make this a true record of my life and with very little or real moralizings or religious exhortations in it. And yet one of the objects of my effort is to show the reader purity of life, purity of thought and noble aspirations in ones every day life are profitable.

Alfred the Great said, I desire to leave behind me a remembrance of me in good works. I can not expect that anything I have done or shall do will tend to so great an influence over so many people and be so enduring as the noble life of that great king who passed out of this life a thousand years ago and left a name and example worthy to be emulated all down through the ages and shall continue to live yet in the future. But if this little effort of mine shall help a few of my beloved to aspire for better lives then I shall be well paid for all it will cost me.

The cold clouds may be black, And the storms beat and blast; But when clouds have gone back, And the storms beat is past
Oh how sweet then to bask In the sunshine so warm!
And who more, then, would ask, Since there's more calm than storm?
 
Just before day, so I was told by one that was there, on the morning of May 18, 1843 a very angry wind and electric storm passed over the infant village of Dublin, Indiana but it was one and the clouds cleared away in time for the people to welcome an ideal May- morning sunrise. As already suggested the village was yet in its infant swaddle and it flourished on the milk of it’s pioneer industry. Right in the midst of that awful storm a wee timy mite of humanity was presented as the first-born ot a humble father and mother in their new frame cottage in the village. This new comer and the varied circumstances surrounding his advent were subjects of gossip among the good women of the village for a number of days. More than sixty years after this notable morning a lady told the writer that she walked three miles that day to see that baby, and she returned to her parental home that evening. He can’t possibly live more’n a few hours?” the women that saw him all agreed. Did you ever see such a wee bit of humanity?! Was a common expression, half interrogation and half exclamation. When he did live a few hours; and when he was seen to behave himself as other young babies did, and when these few hours began to lengthen into days these curious women began to develop a spirit of prophecy and induled in revealing their day-dreams to each other with a very discouraging stock of “if”s”.

"If he does live he will always be a midget.” "If he does live he will always be weakly; for his father is a frail man, and there is not enough of the little mite to lay the foundation for a strong full-grown man. "If he does live his life will be a stormy one, for he was born right in time of that awful. His mother took up the wail of neighbors and poured their discouraging prophecies into the child’s ears so continually that he developed a fixed impression as he came through his childhood and young manhood that he was a confirmed worthless weakling; and that he would die young. It was with some difficulty that he gave up the idea of his worthlessness after he came to his manhood, and it was only by a determined struggle with doubts and fears that that he might die soon that he finally determined that die soon or live long he would make a useful man of himself. His father was Jesse Huddleston and his mother was Editha.	They named their son Samuel Brown Huddleston, for his mother's brother Samuel Brown, a sturdy blacksmith of Dublin who was formerly a saddletree maker.

As already indicated Jesse Huddleston had always been a frail man. He was one of a family of eight sons and five daughters, all of whom, but he, were strong, able bodied men and women. On account of his frailty he had been educated above his brothers and sisters, and while his brothers worked at clearing their farm of the heavy timber, and cultivating the cleared land Jesse was salesman in his fathers "General store," in the country four mi les Southeast of Liberty Union county Indiana. This was called a "general store" but in the sense of the times it could not be so called for no whisky, tobacco, nor goods produced by slave labour were ever kept nor sold there. Jesse Huddleston's parents were Jonathan and Phebe Huddleston and they had such ability in training their children and such influence over them that they all hated slavery, whisky, and tobacco. Jesse was born in Guilford county North Carolina March 7, 1812 and came with his parents to Union County Indiana in 1815 and to Dublin Wayne county in 1835. His father was born near New Bedford Massachusetts October , 17


Jesse Huddleston married Editha, daughter of Isaac and Margaret Brown, in Dublin Indiana in June 1840. She was born on a farm, near Fairfield Franklin county Indiana October 16, 1824 and was therefore fifteen years and about eight months old when she was married. They went to housekeeping in a neat little four roomed cottage that he had just built on a three acre tract of land his father had given him and where he had already commenced to establish himself in the fruit tree nursery business from which nearly all the early orchards and the general nursery stock of this pioneer section were started. Not long after his marriage Jesse Huddleston, full of enterprise and ambition for large success sold out in Dublin and located on the north side of the new National Road west of Cambridge City on land that is now occupied with buildings of the M.E. Parsonage, the residence of Frazier the green house of Mr. Thomas Peat and other residences in Cambridge city.

The author of this writing is the outcome of the much talked of "tiny" son of Jesse and Editha Huddleston and other children were born to them in Cambridge City and Dublin, of whom were six sons and two daughters. Two sons died in infancy and one in young manhood.
 
One of the most vivid recollections of my childhood to which I can fix a date was the 1847. That autumn I, in company with my brother Martin and my infant sister Louisa were taken by our parents a few times to revival meetings in the Methodist Episcopal Church. It was through the persistent persuasion of Miss Jane Brown, an active Christian worker in this Church and a cousin of my Mother that they went to church at this time and place. My father had been raised a Quaker and Mother was born of a "Hardshell" Baptist mother who died when Mother was quite young, but she was left in the settlement with her mothers’ Baptist people until she was ten years old, then her father who was a "Freewill' Baptist brought her away from her mother's people and away from all her old church associations. But my mother would not be drawn away from her mothers’ religion although she had only a crude knowledge of what it was. She understood that it was radically Calvinistic but she knew little of what Calvinism was except that it taught foreordination and predestination. My father was disowned bythe Quakers for marrying out of meeting, and now after attending a few meetings at the Methodist church he wanted to join, but Mother would not, and yet, before she had married she lived several months in the home of the Rev and Mrs. Whitten in Dublin when Mr. Whitten was pastor there, and through their influence she had joined the church without conversion and without giving up her Calvinism, but when she got out from under the influence of the home of the Pastor she dropped out of the church with the excuse that she did not like their Close Communion customs.

Miss Brown sought diligently to persuade my parents to allow her to take me to their Sunday School but through Father joined her in persuading Mother she would not yield and so I never saw inside of a Sunday School until I was a grown up man.

In the early autumn of 1848 I attended my first public subscription school. My teacher was a Mrs. Whitman, and she taught in one end of her husband's blacksmith and wagon shop, on what has ever been know as Carolina Hill. While the children received instructions from Mrs. Whitman in one end of the shop her husband shod horses and pounded iron in the other end of the same building. Instead of a bell to call the children into books" and from the play round Mr. Whitman would pound vigorously upon the anvil. Instead of desks with comfortable seats with backs to them we had rough slabs with the tree bark on the underside and the rough splintery saw-marks on the upper side. The bench legs were rough split pegs inserted in two-inch auger holes and the lower ends of the legs were driven into the earth floor to prevent the benches from falling over. This school lasted six weeks but it turned cold before it was out and the school was moved to the basement story of the teacher's residence nearby. This was a brick building facing west-with much enthusiasm, and for some time she maintained that she had received intelligence from spiritualistic pursuances after this.

In February 1851 my father, having so failed in his health that he could do but little hard work sold out his home and nursery land in Cambridge City, and having already reduced his stock he removed what he had left on hands to rented ground adjoining his residence home, just bought in Dublin and moved to it. Before our removal to Dublin my father had been a frequent attendant at the services of the United Brethren Church in Dublin and I often accompanied him. After locating there, and I being about eight years old I remember distinctly the time and circumstances of my father's coming home from church one day and telling Mother he had been converted and had joined the United Brethren Church. Mother was very much displeased, and she believed it was her duty to let him know it. She was very careful and did all she could to watch me and my brother Martin after this time and prevented Father from reading the Bible to us and from talking to us about God and religion to us, for she had an ambition to make Calvinists out of her children but she was wholely unable to teach. She was uneducated and not apt as a teacher. My father was an apt teacher and being now full of the Christian spirit and believing the end of his life was drawing near he embraced every opportunity he could get to teach us the Bible and the orthodox religion. My father's health continued to fail until he died July 25th 1855, aged 43 years, 4 months, and 18 days. Mother’s age was nearly 31 years at this time and she had six children living. I being the oldest and was a little past twelve years old, and her baby girl was not born until two and a half months after her fathers’ death. Of course Mother must now sell out her nursery stock and discontinue that business. The stock having been gradually run down by my fathers’ brought her only four hundred and fifty dollars at wholesale. She then made an error in selling out her home which she did at a great sacrifice. Property in this undesirable part of the town was very cheap then and she got only one hundred and fifty dollars for it, making her six hundred dollars in hand. Bythe advice of her best friends she then agreed to buy a better home in a better location, but she had a desire to go to her sister in Illinois and so she concluded to get temporary homes for four of her older children and take the two younger ones with her to her sisters, which she did in the winter following Father’s death.

"While others live in poverty
And homeless face the world's cold blast, Shall I expect my lines shall be
In painless ease, and plenty cast? "While other souls despairing stand, And plead, with famished lips today,
Shall I expect that princely hands
Shall scatter roses on my way?

I being the oldest, was the first to find a home among strangers. I was taken on trial by a distant cousin of my father’s on a farm south of Liberty. Mother had a special dislike for the Quakers but when it came to carrying out her ends she did not stop to consider who were to help her do so. This however was a model home and a fine newly married Quaker couple. I went there in November 1855 an stayed until Mother returned from Illinois in April. Then, as soon as it was known that Mother had returned I was sent to her; for I had not pleased these modest, pious Quakers on account of my unchaste speech which they said I had gotten from my mother and they feared I could not be taught to overcome it.

After I was sent home from Union county I stayed with my mother until she got me a home in the family with my brother Martin, where he had lived since early in the spring. This home was about eight miles southwest of my two uncles, Samuel and Nathaniel Brown who worked at their trade, blacksmithing, in a little village on the county line between Rush and Fayette counties, and these uncles had gotten the home for us.	For the sake of this man’s children who are fine people I will not give his true name nor his exact location, but will call him Mr. Anon, and I went there in July, about a year after my father’s death and soon afterward Mother having secured a home for her youngest boy, then about five years old, she made a second trip to Illinois taking her baby girl with her.

The great and notable political campaign of 1856 was just now opening and there were three parties in the field with candidates for the presidency of The Democratic candidates were James Buchanan for president and John C Breckenridge for vice president. The newly organized Republican party had John C Freemont for president and William L. Dayton, for vice president. The American party had Willard Fillmore for president and A J Donelson for vice president. My relations on both sides were all Republicans and Antislavery.	My brother and I had been taught that slavery was a very wicked institution and so we could scarcely be anything but Republicans though the Republican party was not then an antislavery party .
Mr. Anon was a radical pro-slavery Democrat and a local petty politician .

My brother and I had but the clothes we wore when we came here except we had one change of shirts. Mr. Anon had agreed with our mother that he would provide good comfortable winter clothes for us, and so in September he bought butternut jeans cloth for us and Mrs. Anon made us each a coat and a pair of pants. A neighborhood shoemaker came to the home, as was the custom in those days and sat bythe kitchen window and made all the family shoes and boots for Mr. Anon. He also bought hats for us of the hatter at Connersville and when all was done even two pairs of wool socks for each of us, all of our completed outfits were spread out by Mr. Anon, for us to admire. We had much talk between our two selves, and with the family about our prospect of a comfortable winter, with better clothing than we had wore since our father's death, and we were real anxious for winter to come that we might wear them.

When the excitement of the campaign had really opened Martin and I procured a small flag from Mr. Anon's girls and we had a Republican pole-raising in the front yard, and when people came by while we were about the house we would hurrah with all our might for Freemont and Dayton. Mr. Anon was sorely offended when he found it out and hauled our flag down and forbade us to hallow for Freemont. But we were self willed and would not obey him, especially if he was not in hearing; and he was away campaigning much of the time.
 
One cool Sunday morning early in October Mr. Anon called us into the storeroom where had hung our clothes upon the wall where we could see them every time we went there to get a horse blanket, buggy harness, saddles and other stores that were kept there. We went with him at his call, full of joyful expectations. He ordered us to put on our full suits, including our shoes and socks and our new wool hats, for up to this time we had gone barefooted and worn only our thin cotton pants, shirts, and straw hats. When we were fully dressed Mr. Anon took us into the sitting room with his family and allowed us to stand before the looking glass and admire ourselves and hear his wife and young lady daughters admire us a few minutes. Then he said to us: “Now boys these clothes are yours, only on conditions that you will be good Democrats and will yell with all your might for Old Buck (Buchanan) every time you see anybody passing, from now until after the election which will be about a month from now. I am ashamed to have two “black abolition” boys in my home. I have taken great care to get you these nice warm clothes and comfortable as any our neighbor boys, and I believe you will be just as good to me now as I have been to you,- that for my sake you will quit yelling for that old nigger loving Fremont. I hate him; and I would hate you for being for him, but you are too young to know any better. I believe you will now be good Democrat boys - I know you will, Mart …. Now out with it, and you may keep your clothes on, and wear them every day. Now Mart, yell, Hip! Hip! Hurrah for Buchanan!” Martin hesitated, but the temptation was too much for him. His hurrah came without any enthusiasm, but it satisfied Mr. Anon as a beginning and he dismissed him with heart approval.

Then he turned to me and lectured me with much more flattery and length of speech than he did my brother. He reminded me that my brother was only eleven years old and it would not look well for him to be dressed nice and warm while I continued to wear my old thin, faded summer cloths and went bare footed. Then addressing me by name he said, Now Sam, I know you have got too much sense to disobey me, so now I will not ask you to hallow for Buchanan, but I will only forbid you telling any body that you are a Republican. You need only tell people that ask you, that you are a Democrat. If you will promise me that you will do that you may out as your brother has, with your new clothes on. Will you do it?” I answered quickly and with emphasis: "No! I will not pretend to be what I am not, and what I never will be.”My reply angered Mr. Anon and he said to me sharply: "Sam, hear what I am telling you. Winter is coming, and your mother is in Illinois and will not be back soon. I will freeze that nigger-loving abolitionism out of you, or I will freeze you to death before Christmas. Now do you understand I was disappointed at the price of my clothes, but I had purposed in my heart that I would not defile my self by lying for them. I would die rather than barter my volition, so I hastily put off the clothes and remembered them only with scorn and left the house. I did not mortify Mr. Anon, however, by telling any one I was a Republican unless I was pressed for an answer to their questionings, while I was depending on him for a home.

The pleasant autumn days soon passed and white frosts were followed by cold rains and spits of snow before election day came. I had been asked repeatedly, by Mr. Anon, if I was ready to swap off my "Abolition party” for a "White man's party, II with a suit of clothes to boot, but even the suggestion of such a thing to me seemed criminal. I did not like for anyone to suppose I would sell out my sacred principles for a suit of clothes.

I did chores about the house and barn, and brought the cows and horses from the pasture of mornings where, at times, I left the tracks of my bare and bleeding feet upon saw the cold clouds flying by day and the twinkling stars by night I remembered my father used to tell me that God made the clouds pour out rain and sleet and snow that the earth might have seedtime and harvest, and the shining stars, he said, reminded us that his eyes were ever open to see our acts and to patiently watch over us while we slept in the nighttime. I wondered if my beloved departed father, too, was looking down from heaven and saw my acts and knew even my secret thoughts. If he did, I was sure that he loved me now
as much as he loved me while he was on earth and he was taking notice of any suffering here. I loved to cherish such thoughts. They made me strong in my determination to do right, no matter what the cost might be. I do not remember that I ever formulated a prayer to God in words, but my whole being was full of reverent piety and trustfulness of his mercy and watchfulness for my good. Were not such childlike meditations and trustfulness enough to move the pen of the recording angel to give me the promised blessings of heaven upon children? Would that I had always kept my childhood innocence and zeal for a simple Christian life as I had it in those days.
 
A new doctor had just located in the nearby village and was getting some practice. He was a young man and although the political excitement was running high he seemed to know nothing outside of his profession, and the people were wondering how he would vote. His most intimate friends had failed to draw him out to commit himself; but he was a native of Maryland and therefore the Democrats were claiming him, and the Republicans were making no claims on him at all. Mr. Anon liked him very much, and he spent as much time loafing in his office as he could. The people were whispering to each other that Mr. Anon was courting the doctor for his daughter Virginia. The doctor would have very easily and quickly become a very popular man in the village and neighborhood, but from some unaccountable reason he held himself entirely aloof from society circles. The writer's better acquaintance and more intimate association with this doctor a few years later has made this introduction of him, at this time, seem proper and fitting. His right name is doubtful even. to the writer and from the fact of our accidental meeting and recognition of each other when we were soldier comrades, and from the fact that I was placed under a pledge at our first meeting there that I would never call him by the name that was known in this settlement I will here call him Dr. Jacques, a name that will not be found upon our Muster Roll. During a Democratic street meeting one evening near the close of the campaign, Dr. Jacques stood by the speaker's stand and faced nearly all the audience. He had been invited as a mark of distinction, to a seat in the speaker’s stand, but this honor he declined.	Near the close of the speech the speaker cried out "Is there one Abolitionist in all this splendid audience?" A husky voice like that of an old man, a way back of the crowd answered, “Yes sir, there’s hund’rd of “m. Then the speaker said, “Did you hear that, ladies? One third of this splendid audience wants nigger wives! Do you believe it?” A shrieking voice like an old woman’s over in another part of the audience seemed to answer, “They’d as well have nigger wives as for us to have drunken husbands!” The speaker was a well known drunken petty politician from a nearby county seat town; and many of his hearers knew that he was drunk at this time. The rebuke sent terror to the hearts of the local party leaders and an effort was made to locate the supposed woman offender. Nobody suspicioned that it was a clever ventriloquist. But just about six years later Dr. Jacques told the writer that he was the fellow that did it!”

Election day came and it was accompanied by a cold November rain that turned to snow in the afternoon, and a strong wind was blowing from the northwest. I was compelled to do my out of doors chores about the barn and I brought up the cows from the pasture about thirty rods away in the morning and evening and on the following morning, leaving the tracks of my bare and bleeding feet wherever I went. The next morning was very cold for the time in the year and the wind was still blowing.

While we were at the barn this morning Martin scolded me sharply for what he called “my contrariness,” He declared I had better be a democrat than to freeze to death. I was too cold to talk back to him; but I knew I was not democrat and I told him I would rather die than to say I believed it was right to hold people in slavery because they were black. Mr. Anon was absent from home much of the time and when he was away I kept my feet tied up with old rags that my brother and Mrs. Anon and her step daughters helped to keep within my reach, and I also wore a horse-blanket wrapped about me. But Mr. Anon caught me thus wrapped twice, and he snatched the wrapping off of me and sharply commanded his wife and daughters and my brother to see that I was not thus protected from the cold.

The morning after the election, when breakfast was over Mr. Anon ordered me to saddle his riding horse and bring him out to the kitchen door for him to mount and ride to town to get the election news, People road on horseback nearly all together in those days for the roads were un-graveled and very muddy and buggies and carriages were little used. When I brought the horse to the door' met Mr. Anon coming out wrapped in his great coat, high fir collar, fir cap with ear mufflers, and great fir gloves. While he was mounting his horse I walked down the driveway to the front gate, opened it and let him ride out. Just outside the gate he stopped as he usually did when he was going away, and there he gave me orders for the work I must do while he was gone. "Now Sam,” he began, “ this is a pretty cold morning for one to be out dressed as thinly as you are, so you must hot around and keep your blood moving, or you will freeze to death. You have been a pretty good boy, generally, and if you had not been a 'Black Abolitionist' would have dressed you up like your brother and you would not have to stand here shivering and half froze to death as you are now, and you know it. I hate a "Black Republican Nigger Lover," and my money shall not buy a stitch of cloths for one of them to wear. I’m going to town now to get the news that I hope willput an end to your low down hateful wooly headed abolitionism and bring you to your senses before the next election. Now Sam, don't you hope Buchanan is elected?" “No, I don't," I quickly answered, and then he resumed his lecture to hold me there, it seemed to me, in torture of cold from which I was shaking violently; "Now Sam," he continued," you must be a good boy today, and we will get along all right after a while. You know I have been good to you. I have never got mad and whipped you: I have never even threatened to whip you. I have tried to persuade you byshowing you what is right and what is wrong. Now shut the gate and go across the calf lot to the cornfield and shuck
twenty baskets full of corn and carry it out to the hogs. By the time you get that done I will be back. Then if the news is all right I will give you your cloths. You don't deserve them, but I think it may be best for me to give them to you whether you are good me or not. You know Sam, that you have no home, and no friends and I have given you a home because I pitied you. I see, Sam, that you are so cold now, that I had better let you go to
the house and get warm and then put your cloths on before you need go to the field, if you will only say that
you hope Buchanan is elected. Now will you do that much to get the clothes you need so much. "No sir! I will die rather than tell you I want something that I do not want at all." Then as he rode away he said held break my stubborn will or I would die with a garment that his money had bought.

Ships that ride deepest in the spray The most of commerce bears away
On branches that bend near the ground The choicest, sweetest fruit is found.
In deepest forest shades we hear The nightingale's song, sweet and clear.
The nest that in the low grass lies
Sends forth the lark that highest flies. The soul with crosses most bent down Will, in the end, wear richest crown.

Some readers may be angry with me because I did not surrender my consciousness of right and wrong, for at least a brief period, for the sake of avoiding my painful torture. They may say that politics is nothing to a thirteen-year old boy, and therefore I should have surrendered to Mr. Anon for the good and comfortable clothes he offered me. But such should know that I was then in the most critical period of my building of character.	The yielding of one’s will to do what he thinks is wrong than at any age in life, but at any time in life it is an injury to one’s moral being to surrender to an act of wrong doing. Then again, if the reader suggests that I ought to have run away, I did not have the liberty to do so. My mother had put me here to stay, at least until she had returned from Illinois, and I felt that I had a no moral right to disobey her. And if I had any inclination to leave here I had no place to go. True I had two uncles eight miles away who were my mother’s brothers, but I dare not go to them without they had bid me come. It has been said that the “Stars shine brightest in the darkest night; torches are better by beating them; spices smell sweetest when they are pounded; gold looks brighter for scouring; such are the conditions of me; they are most triumphant when most tempted.” To make this saying true, however, a man must not allow the temptations to overcome him. As I look back to my childhood, now, I can but know that the most noble traits of my moral character were formed and fixed in me under my severest afflictions and tests; and all of my sinful indulgences came upon me through my weakness that were always present and now can be seen as I look back to the times of relaxation that came when I felt that I was under little or no outward restraint.

On that cold November morning, I stood shivering and almost unconscious holding on to the gate for support while I listened to the lecture and orders from Mr. Anon. As I watched him ride away in comfort, and even luxury I did not envy him, nor even censure him for his cruelty to me. I submitted to all that must come upon me and took it uncomplainingly and fearlessly, even though when I climbed over the rail fence and started hobbling across the snow-carpeted lot to the cornfield I felt a sinking sensation and believed I would die in that lot. Mrs. Anon and her three step-daughters, noble hearted women, told me afterward that they watched me from their window and as soon as they dare come to my rescue, when the lord of the home was so far away that he would not see them they came to my rescue. They saw me sink down into un-conciousness in the lot just as they were leaving the house to come to me. They carried me to the house and put me in Mrs.
 
Anon's bed, and one of the girls went to the field where my brother was husking corn and ordered him to go to town as quickly as he could ride, on a spare horse that stood in the stable, and bring Dr Jaques. He was bidden to avoid meeting, or being seen by Mr. Anon, if possible. While my brother was riding away and returning with the doctor the women were restoring me to consciousness, which they had accomplished before the doctor arrived. On their way to me my brother told the doctor all he could about my forced exposure; how he had seen the tracks of my bloody feet in the snow; and how he had plead with me to get relief by saying I was a democrat. Some one in the village told Mr. Anon that they had just seen my brother ride out of town with the doctor, and so he hastily followed them and caught up with them just as they reached the gate . Mr. Anon was greatly excited and asked who it was that needed the doctor in such haste. The doctor did not tarry to explain but my brother told him, it was I. As soon as the doctor warmed his hands a moment at the open fireplace he came to me where I lay moaning in great suffering, and addressing me he said, "Well, my young man, I have come to see what I can do for you. Where do you hurt most?	I told him I had been frozen almost to death and that my feet were very badly frozen -	Mr. Anon interrupted me and as I was attempting to uncover my feet he came between me and the doctor and replaced the cover over me and began his explanation of my condition, saying my "feet had been sore all fall and on that account I had not been able to wear my new shoes that he had bought me with his own money. I was a puny boy, always sickly and only able to do light chores about the house and barn. He said he was taking care of me because I was a homeless and helpless orphan boy that was not able to do work enough to earn his board; but through charity he had bought, and paid for, out of his own money, a complete suit of cloths, including shoes, socks, and hat, and he ordered my brother to bring them all out and show them to the doctor. While the clothes were being brought he kept up such a flow glib-gabbet that no one else could find place to speak a word. But the doctor interrupted him a time or two by asking me questions which, however he answered himself, not allowing me to say a word. And as soon as he had exhibited the clothing and his own generosity he told the doctor that he should not do any thing for me for he would bundle me up nicely and take me to my uncles, eight miles away where, he said, my mother had arrived a few days ago from her visit in Illinois, for he had just seen a man of that village who told him he knew she was there and he had determined that he would take me to her that afternoon. Then he asked the doctor to give him a written statement of his charge for the visit and said he would do his best to collect it from my mother and bring it to him that evening, but the doctor said "No, Mr Anon, I cannot do that. I came out here on an order from your wife and I cannot take a stranger for it, one who is just visiting in this county.

And so the doctor left Mr. Anon's home under a spirited dispute with him. I was a helpless invalid all that winter, and in a destitute condition, for Mr. Anon forgot his streak of generosity as soon as the doctor was gone and did not allow me to have an article of clothing that he had bought for me. By the generosity of my uncles, my mother's brothers, and other good neighbors of theirs I was soon comfortably clothed for the winter. I was kept at this place with my mother, until the middle of the next summer, for she had no money and no" means for housekeeping by the time she ended her second visit to Illinois.

In the midsummer r of 1857 mother took me and the baby to Dublin where my grand-father Huddleston furnished her a house free of rent and with the actual necessities for housekeeping.

Now it is with much hesitation that I speak here as I have done before of my dear old mother's faults and failures, but my words will, I believe, in no wise injure here, and I speak of them with a hope that whatever I may have said and what I may yet say of her on this line may have an effect to prompt others to escape failures. When she sold and gave away everything she had less than two years ago, she found homes for all of her children except her baby and with six hundred dollars in cash she quit housekeeping and intended to live with her sister in Illinois and with other relatives here. She had an avowed disliking, if not a hatred toward all of her late husbands’ brothers and sisters except to one sister and one brother, and especially toward her father in law, and now with not a dollar in money and no property of any sort she was forced by her destitute and homeless condition to accept the kind tender of her father-in-law, my grandfather- Jonathan Huddleston of a house to live in and furniture to set her up at housekeeping on the east side of South Milton street in Dublin all free to her as long as she was in need of it. All of my fathers’ people were kind and helpful to her.
It was now in the Mid-summer of 1857. I had regained my normal health and strength and got ready employment about town. Mother was a good seamstress and got steady employment from our home tailors.
 
In those days there were pork packers in many of the little towns throughout the county and about all the hogs that were raised in this vicinity were slaughtered and packed here at home. My uncle Nathan Huddleston gave me work in his slaughter-house all the winter of 1857-8, at fifty cents a day, and Mother and I thought that was splendid wages. Mother got every cent of money I earned for I-had not dared to spend even one penny without her knowledge and consent. I was in the fifteenth year of my age but I was small of statue and of delicate appearance. Mother commenced that winter to explain to me what she understood were advantages to a man belonging to some Secret Society as soon as I should be old enough. Her highest
ambition was to get a clerkship for me in some dry goods or grocery store, or a position as book-keeper in some office. She knew I was naturally a good penman and she thought that was all the requirement I needed for book-keeping. She thought I had a good education when I could write plainly and could read in the first reader, but I knew nothing of arithmatic and spelling. She tried, as soon as hog killing time was over to get a job for me in the stores and offices but when she was informed that I must go to school six or eight more years before I could ever hope for such employment she gave that ambition up; for, she said she did not intend to have her children ruined by sending them to school. Education, she said, made people proud, lazy and sinful.

During the revival meetings at my father's church I had a desire to go to church and that desire grew upon me until Mother became alarmed and had fears that she might not be able to keep me away if I should stay in town, so as soon as I was out of work at the slaughter house early in March she sent me to the country to hunt a job on a farm. I did what I could to overcome her plan in this, for I knew I could earn more money in town, but she said she could no longer endure the taunts I was getting by the young people here; for in truth ever boy of my age except two, teased me continuously, because I was poor and because my mother kept me closely under her care. I was never seen upon the streets or away from home except on business. Many people in town did not like my mother and talked before their children of their dislikes for her and this was the chief influence that drove them to abuse me. And so Mother used this problem of my abuse in urging me to go to the country. I did not dare think of open rebellion against her will but I said, "When I become a man I intend to settle in Dublin; and I will live here all the days of my life; and the people of Dublin will some day look up to me as one of her best citizens.

When I left home Mother said to me, "Go toward Bentonville, and do not ask any body for work until you have gone four miles from home; then going on Southward stop at every house and ask for work. Keep going from house to house till you get work.” I had walked eight miles from home and had no success. Nobody wanted so frail a looking boy as I was. At about two o’clock I met a man building fence along the roadside. When I asked him for work he took much interest in me, asked my name and where I lived and when he found that I was a poor fatherless boy he said I should stop with him until I found work. He had two boys of his own that were about my age. As we stood there talking he made a mental canvass of the entire neighborhood until I at last he told me of a young married man that he had heard say he would hire a boy to do chores, about the house and barn if he could find one he liked, and when he had directed me to the place he told me to come back to his home and stay all night if I did not get work. When I turned in at Mr. Marion’s home I told him who I was and where I lived, and that Mr. Rhodes had advised me to call on him. I met with immediate encouragement here, and when he had asked me a few questions about my willingness to do the sort of work he had for me, my price etc. I contracted to work one month on trial for five dollars. I felt pretty certain that if I could please him during the rough month of this time in the year I could hold my job during all the busy summer months. He then took me into the house from where I met him at the barn, and introduced me to his wife, and told her I had walked all day hunting work and had eaten nothing since early in the morning, and that he had hired me for one month for five dollars, of course my board and washing was expected from them.


It is said that the lion will turn and flee From a maid in the pride of her purity But the maid, if she be a wise little thing 
Will keep out of the way of the beastly king
And just so with the youth when old Satan draws nigh
 
In his cunning to lead you to sin he will try, With his promise of safety and pleasure-some joy
But beware lest his wiles your true manhood destroy

At the close of the trial month I was rehired and the events of a whole year at this place would make a long story; but I will relate only the incident of my connection with the Secret Order of Hoot-Owls.”	I do not give the true names of any of the people of this settlement, because some of them and a number of their descendents are still living and they have long been honest and highly respected citizens. It was well known that eight neighborhood boys of highly respectable families were closely associated together in social meetings and it was supposed that they were simply rambling along Williams Creek, or through the great forests, for there were still great bodies of native timber in the country then. There was no thought any where among the families that these boys were engaged in any immoral or unlawful acts. Their meeting place was not known. They talked very little about their Order, in public, and when pressed by outside persons they only ascertained that they had a place of meeting for social past-time and that they met in the woods. "Now boys," said Joe Underland to his seven companions, one Sunday morning, "We’ll go down to Frank Marion's and get Sam Huddleston to go with us. You know we elected him to membership last Sunday, and we’ll initiate him today.”

Charles Marion, a nephew to Frank Marion said, “you don't know Sam as well as I do, Joe, or you would not be so sure that your plan would work out. He's a very pious fellow, and I'll bet my Sunday boots that he'll not go off with gang of rough fellows unless we play mighty pious and make him believe we're running a sort of Sunday School Society." I think we'll have more trouble to keep him, than to get him," said Jake Cline. "We don't care whether we keep him or not, just so we can get him to help us to work out a way of getting into Frank Marion’s home, that we have failed to do for the past three or four months,” said Bob Davidson.	“I suggest,”	said Ben Peters, “that Jim Rhodes and Charles Marion go alone and coax him out, and tell him about our lodge and coax him to be initiated. Sam is better acquainted with them than he is with us, and I suppose he likes Jim because his father helped him to get a job. And then they are about the same age, you know. “

This plan was adopted, and when the two boys started down the road toward the Marion home the other boys went into the woods and started toward the “Owl’s Nest”, in the “Fallen Timber," where they were to await the coming of their two companions with their prospective new member. If I had been left to my own choices I wouId not have gone with the boys, for when they had almost abandoned their hope of persuading me to go with them Frank Marion, who heard all the conversation while he sat reading his weekly newspaper just inside the sitting room and I sat on the front door-step. When Mr. Marion found that I was not inclined to go with them he first suggested that I ought to form a kindly association with my neighbor boys; and then seeing that his suggestion would not move me to go he told me that I must go. The boys had not mentioned to me the object of their ramble, nor that we were to join the boys in the woods until we were ourselves; beyond the barn yard and in the "Big Woods.” Now they commenced to explain to me that the object of our social stroll was that they might tell me about a "Secret Society," a real "lodge" they had, and that eight of the best boys in the neighborhood had already joined it. They said I had been elected to membership on last Sunday and they had been sent to notify me and bring me to their lodge for initiation. I thought of my mother's advice to join a lodge and not knowing that there was, or could be a bad lodge I was very easily drawn into their association. I asked the two boys many questions, however, about the objects, principles, and benefits of their lodge and was told that it was highly beneficial, socially, morally, and educational; that because I was a poor boy other members of the lodge that were able had paid my initiation fee just because they liked me and wanted my help and influence. When I had agreed to join the order I was told that we were on our way to the lodge and that all the other members were there waiting to initiate me. Other features were explained to me after I had been conducted through a tangled thicket in the center of a strip of woodland where the great trees had nearly all been blown down bya hurricane, some years before and it had grown up with young trees and tangled vines, so dense that in some places it was next to impossible for man to pass through. I was told
 
that I might consider the initiation into the first degree a little rude and disagreeable to my taste and liking but the second degree would be nothing whatever but a lecture and instructions as to what would be required of me. The initiation was indeed rude and very objectionable to me but I was taken through it by physical force and I was compelled to make promises that were very objectionable, and I made up my mind that I would not meet with them again nor associate with them.

On Sunday morning about three weeks later Mr. and Mrs. Marion told me that they were going away to spend the day and that I must go into the woods and digging ginseng to get money to pay for my winter clothing. I protested against working on Sunday, but he said I must, and since I had never disobeyed my parents I felt that while I was here I was under obligation to obey him after I had failed in my endeavor to have him reverse his command and allow me to stay about the house, or go on a visit to my brother Calvin who lived with a Mr. Baker, a few miles away; so after they were gone I took a mattock on my shoulder and a bag to carry the precious roots in and with great reluctance I there was no way to avoid meeting them. They told me they had seen Mr. and Mrs. Marion when they were on their way to their place of visiting and Mr. Marion had told them where they would find questions or to speak a word until I was told to speak. Presently I thrust my hands into my trousers pockets and missed my house key and the boys watching my every movement and every expression again cautioned me not to speak d word, and thus I remained here in forced imprisonment and silence until it was almost sundown, at which time the Underland boys came in bearing a large feed basket full of valuable silver ware, jewelry and other household keepsakes. I recognized the basket as the property of the Marion barn, and I knew many of the articles in the basket, for I had seen them in the Marion home. As soon as the basket was set down Joe Underland turned to me and said, "Now Sam, we have made a pretty good haul, and you must remember you are Hoot-Owl, as well as we are; and don't forget the penalty. If you are not true to us you will wish you had never been born.	Remember the oath you have taken was Secrecy or death: and horrible death it will be.

We have concluded that you will never make a good Hoot-Owl and so I will tell you now what we have determined you shall do. You must leave this settlement at once. You must not return to Frank Marion's; for, if you do we have the matter fixed so that you will be arrested and taken to jail before morning, for robbery; and we - every one of us - will. We all know that you and old John Lamson’s are intimate. You often go there. We will swear that we saw you two going away from the Marion home carrying this basket when we were on our way out here today and that you went toward the Lamson home. Sam here is the key. I took it from your pocket. You have no other need for it than to remind you that it is not safe to trust your trousers with other boys while they are making a "Hoot-owl" out of you take it, and, here, take this purse. I found it in the cupboard with ninety dollars in it. We have taken out seventy dollars for ourselves and we give you the purse and twenty dollars. Now don't go to Dublin. Go South and don't stop till you are in the mountains of Kentucky of you do you will be caught and sent to the penitentiary. The money will last till you get there and then you can get work. Now go. Do not stop to rest till morning or you will b e caught. Keep out of all towns and avoid meeting people as much as you can."	I had my plan of action matured before Joe Underland ended his speech to me. I was the youngest boy in the Order, I being only fifteen years old and the ages of the other boys ran from eighteen to twenty-eight. I gracefully accepted door key and purse and when I had been cordially complemented by them for my quick decision to take their advice and flee they bade me good-by.

I walked hastily along the creek until I had passed out of hearing of the boys and then I sat down to meditate and to allow the boys all to have time to get out of the woods and be in their homes. While here I thought of my mother1s wish that I might get work in the township that boosted that it had no church in its borders, and I thought of how I had suffered this trouble to be forced upon me by allowing Mr. Marion to drive me against my will to go into the woods with the boys three weeks before now and again today to drive me against my conviction of right to go into the woods and dig ging-sang. When I had finally changed my course after resuming my supposed long journey I came in sight of the Marion home and saw that it was still lighted and so I stopped here until it was darkened and I knew Mr. and Mrs. Marion had retired and I remained quiet for at least a half an hour longer and then with a quickened heartbeat, feeling the weight of the responsibility of the task I had taken to clear myself of this dreadful wrong; and the possibility that I might fail to make the necessary impression upon Mr. and Mrs. Marion to get them to trust me far enough to help me to carry out my plans of proving my entire innocence and of the possibility that I might, after all, be sent to prison in my innocense.
 
But, possibly at about midnight the keen scented coon dog and his powerful companion, the bull dog gave a few subdued barks and came playfully out to meet me. I knew, by this, that there were no spies from the Owls Nest nearby, unless it might be possible that Frank’s nephew, Charles, might have stayed here all night, as he did occasionally, In this event my purposes and my success in wining Mr. Marion1s help in carrying out my plan would be a sure failure. The dogs were heard by Mr. and Mrs. Marion and very soon I saw the light of a candle blaze in the siting room. They knew someone was coming and so he got up and dressed and was ready to meet me at the door. The first words I spoke were "ls Charley here?”	Mr Marion answered me very cross and threatening "No! But he was here and, you thief! He saw you and Old Samson robing my house!	He swore profanely that he and his boy associates would swear that they saw us carry the feed-basket full of stuff away from here toward Old Lambert's. Fortunately for me he knew that the dogs had scented my approach and that I had come from the direction opposite the Lambert home. My first pleading was that he should darken the house lest my feared spies might see the light and suspicion my presence and come to us, but I finally prevailed on him to grant me my request. But for a long time he seemed to be determined to rush me off to jail before -Icould have a chance to even gain admission to his home and sit down quietly and reason together, so that I might tell hi m my story that I was trying to convince him would make him know to an absolute certainty who were the robbers.

Finally I won the sympathy of Mrs. Marion and was allowed to come into the house and here we talked for two full hours before Mr. Marion would as much as allow me to suggest how he might know positively that I was innocent and who were guilty. He insisted from the beginning of my pleading for justice, that I tell him who I would accuse but I would not give a name nor an intimation until he softened enough to agree to help me faithfully to carry out my plan. Then I began with the time he forced me to go with the two boys into the woods. Then I told him how he had sent the boys to me this Sunday morning and they compelled me to go with them to the Owl's Nest and how they had procured my door key and held me a prisoner until they knew the thieves were coming near. When I had finished my story thus far Mr. Marion interrupted me saying, “Well Sam you tell a thrilling story, but how are you going to prove it? You admit that there are eight witnesses against.” I answered lf you will hear me further I will tell you how the boys will convict themselves and clear me. You will allow me to keep in close hiding until two oclock next Sunday. During this week you must summons the fathers of each of the boys except the grandfather of the one whose father is dead. Have them all to place themselves carefully to conseal themselves in hiding in the thicket around the Owl's Nest and await there until the boys come. I will also be in hiding foras I have told you they suppose I have taken flight to the mountains of Kentucky and when they have assembled I will surprise them by appearing for admission to their Lodge. Giving the secret signs they will admit me and I will talk the matter of todays doings over with them in your hearing.”

The plans were all successfully worked out. After I had submitted to a very sharp tongue lashing from the boys for coming back to them I very easily referred them back to the operations of the previous Sunday without arousing their suspicions of danger and they talked freely with me and laughingly admitted their guilt and my entire innocence, after I had solemnly and truthfully declared to them that I would never be seen by them in one of their meetings after today and that I had been in hiding all the week and had come back for the purpose of helping them to keep out of trouble. When the old men were fully convinced of the truths I had declared to Mr Marion they demanded the surrender of the boys, all speaking simultaneously and from every point around them and then rushing in upon them as quickly as possible. After a long consultation between the boys and their fathers the mad, sullen and revengeful spirit of the boys was broken and an agreeable conclusion was reached, whereby the boys were all assured that their crimes should never be made known to anyone, and they each gave a solemn pledge that they would never again repeat their crimes, but they would pay for, or restore all their stolen property, and that they would treat me as their friend. The oldest member of their Lodge, however never spoke to me afterward, but sullenly avoided me. 54 years have passed and I and only one other man that knew of this transaction are now living.

What you are, it hath been said Doth ring so loudly in my ear
That words you speak fall dull and dead
And words you speak I can not hear.

After staying my time out in the Marion home and having pleasant associations with all but one of the boys who were former members of the Hoot-owl Lodge I returned to Dublin with a mind to stay at home, and I did well working about town.

About the middle of December 1859 there arose a contention between me and my mother that made us disagree in matters of religion as long as we lived together. I had determined that I would be an Arminian Christian and that I would go to church. She admitted that she had kept me out of town to keep me away from the churches and she intended to keep me away from them as much as she could.	I have written a little book on	my religious life and so I do not purpose to dwell much on this subject in this book.	I t is enough for me to say that I joined the United Brethren Church without conversion because my mother would not allow me the privilege of going to the mourners bench, and having had no instruction on the subject of conversion I was at an utter loss to know how to do more than accept my mother’s offer of church membership.	She tried a number of schemes during the winter to induce me to leave town but failed in them all; but in the following summer she reduced my clothes to patches and rags and urged me to stay away from church for the want of respectable clothing but I would not.	In the autumn of 1860 a wealthy lady gave me a full suit of good black clothes, a felt hat, a pair of fine boots and two changes of under clothes.
They were all about as good as new and her only son had outgrown them.	Mother tried to shame me out of wearing them; telling me that everybody in town would know they were Bill Lawrences old clothes.	She protested so strong that I did not wear them until in February 1861 she persuaded me to go on a visit to her mothers’ people in Franklin county, saying she would allow me to wear my cloths if I would go.

She said they were well-to-do farmers and good, rich Baptist people and she wished I would get work with them and learn their religion, and perhaps I could find a rich Calvinist Baptist girl there that I could marry. She gave me thirty cents and I left home near the last of February and walked to Connersville, where I stayed all night and paid all my money for my supper, lodging, and breakfast. The next morning when the Land lady, a widow had given me directions from there to West Union (now Everton) and when I was about to leave she gave me ten cents and told me to go to the bakery, that she pointed out, and buy me some cakes and crackers for my dinner.

I arrived at the home of Mother’s uncle Elisha Harrell, east of Everton, that evening and was heartily welcomed by them. And I was surprised at finding children and young men and women in the home. Mother had known almost nothing about the families of her kindred here for although they lived only a few miles away she had not seen them since she was a child and she had scarcely' heard from them. Letter writing, in those days was sparingly practiced and people rarely visited even near relatives that lived twenty five miles or further away. I visited here a few days, and regretted when the time came that I must go to see other relatives. I had never before been treated as a guest in a well-to-do home. I had an ambition to know how to behave myself in company, but my sense of my ignorance and awkwardness embarrassed me so much that I could not make my self free in the company of young people. So I held myself in the background from them and could be free with only Mothers Uncle Elisha and Aunt Margaret.

After I had stayed here two or three days my cousin James Harrell who was about my age	took me on horseback to visit Mother’s Aunt Jane Buckley who lived about three miles further South and two and a half miles west of the town of Fairfield; a sister to Uncle Elisha Harrell and to Mothers mother. Aunt Jane was a widowed farmer, with two daughters and three sons at home and some of them were a little older and some younger than myself. I soon learned to love this family a little more than I had ever loved any outside of the circle of my immediate home folks. Uncle Elisha's family had done all they could to make my short visit with them enjoyable, but there are certain affinities of character, or likes and dislikes that sometimes spring up, or are recognized at early acquaintance that are endearing and lasting; while other persons who may not be drawn quite so close to us in our sympathies they are equally noble in their character. The sister-like freedom and tactful cordiality of my cousin Miss Mattie R. Buckley who was just a little younger than myself; and the brotherly kindness of John and his brother Anson E. and the motherly solicitude of Aunt Jane and altogether with the younger son and daughters kindness was just the character of personalities that I needed to develop my ambition to make a true man of myself.
 
After I had been here two or three days Aunt Jane's youngest son, James, took me on horseback to Fairfield to see another sister to my Grandmother Brown, Aunt Susan Turner. Her husband was Dr. John Turner, a good and very first class citizen of his town, and county. Aunt Susan was the only real uncompromising Calvinistic Baptist in the relationship. The others had allowed their children to drift away from what had become a very unpopular, and to thinking people of this day a very un-wise and unchristian religion and they were tending toward Methodism. Among the first questions that Aunt Susan asked me was, "Are your mother and her brothers and sister true to their mother’s church? “ I answered, "Mother professes to believe in the doctrine, but she can’t read and she never heard a Baptist sermon preached since she was a child and so I think she don ‘t know what she believes. Her father, you may remember, is a Means Baptist. Aunt Eliza makes no profession at all; Uncle Sam is a Methodist Class-leader, and Uncle Nathaniel is a Methodist preacher.” I spoke of my uncles attainments with some emphasis, for I was proud of them; but she gave several of her characteristic groans while I was talking and when I told her all I was asked to tell her she said “Oh, my poor sister Peggy, I am glad the Lord took her to glory while them boys were little, for she was too good to see that all of her children but, may be, your mother are predestinated to endless torment.	If they had been elected to grace they would not have been heretics.”

On the first day of my visit at Aunt Jane’s Mattie told me of my mother's cousin Stephen Harrell, who .lived only a half mile away and whose step daughter, whom she called Sallie E. Johnson was just her age, and she declared she was the favorite girl of all this settlement. She described her as of medium height, blue eyes, fair complexion, medium dark wavy hair, not beautiful featured, but of a beautiful Christian character, and a member of the Methodist Church. Her mother was a woman of splendid Christian character and her own father in his lifetime had been a Methodist preacher. I perceived immediately that Mattie was anxious that I should meet and admire her friend, but I was made to dread the meeting and to feel that her anxiety had inclined me against her. It seems to be a natural endowment of the young to choose their own mates and it very often occurs that the effort, when it is recognized, of a third party, to make a match drives the couple away from each other.

Of course I must go and see Mothers’ cousin Stephen and Cousin James went with me. It was a beautiful day for out of doors romps and Sallie happened to have the company of a neighbor girl, an intimate associate of hers and while I sat talking with Mothers cousin the two girls were racing and romping about the door yard, the orchard, and the barn, and made up my mind that she was rude and immoderate in her play and I became so angry at her that I would not stay for dinner even though I knew I was expected to stay. When I returned to Aunt Jane’s and when she found out why I would not stay, she told me that the girls were not expected to be my company and that their rompings and racings were only marks of healthy buoyance that makes the young strong and vigorous and she was as sure as could be that neither of the girls were rude nor imprudent in their character; but she said I had acted real rudely in leaving the home when I knew I was expected to stay for dinner.	I apologized to Aunt Jane and promised that I would go again if I was wanted. She assured me that they should not know why I had left their home and that she would see that I should have another invitation, and so in a couple of days I went again and stayed all night with them. Miss Johnson, in her natural way did what she could to help entertain me and I had a real pleasant visit with the family, but my mind was made up that I did not, and I would not like the girl.

After a two weeks visit in the country, I returned home without much effort to get work. I told Mother that I Ii ked her people but it was true that none of them had any need of hired help. They were only farmers of moderate means. The country was broken and not able to make them more than a living, and I could do better in a more prosperous section. She was disappointed - even grieved at my return and my dissatisfaction with the country. She thought my judgment was at fault, or that I was only homesick for Dublin.

I found my brother Martin at home sick with measles, and now I had come home to add to her trouble by exposing my own self to the disease. She now had four of her children to nurse through the sickness and also to support by her daily toil. Her work was mostly away from home so the sick must be neglected to some extent though the malady was of a very light form until it came to me. And I was the last to take it. When it was thought that I was about to recover I was taken with a relapse and became unconscious, and was in this condition at the time of the opening of the Civil War and in time of the fall of Fort Sumpter. I was not able to
 
go to earn wages that year until October and Mother often reproached me while she was struggling so hard to make a living during my tedious convalescence because I did not stay in Franklin county. Early in the Autumn I got work running the bark-mill in the Cambridge City Tannery, and I worked almost continuously all the winter. My health seemed excellent during the spring and summer and I worked in buoyant hope that I would get an increase hi wages very soon, for so many young men were going into the army that laborers were scarce and hard to get.

Every day after the fall of Fort Sumpter was a day of intense' excitement in Dublin as it was every where else. The daily papers were not as plentiful as they are now (1912) and good readers would read aloud in stores, shops, and street corners, wherever crowds of people would congregate to hear. Ham Collins, Sr., a shoe maker was the most popular reader in Dublin; and no matter how much he was rushed with work in his shoe shop he would lay his work by and read the news as soon as the paper came, every was always full of hearers. Mr. Collins was also a good tenor drummer and he would sometimes beat his drum alone; sometimes accompanied with a bass drum and a fife, and the more noise they would make the better.
Men were volunteering and going into camps as fast as they could be armed, and equipped. In the
mid-summer of "1862 when my brother Martin was seventeen and a half years old he volunteered and went to Camp Morton at Indianapolis where his regiment was organized.

I took a deep interest in the struggle and I embraced every possible opportunity to hear the papers read. I said very little about the war, for although I hated slavery, I held strongly to the Quaker's peace principles. I knew that we were now in the beginning of a dreadful war and I knew that its final ending was a matter of uncertainty. Of course many were saying that it would be a short struggle and so the first enlistments were only for three months, but cooler minds saw a long and desperate struggle before us, but they knew that at that time it would not do to call for long termed volunteers. I could not for one moment entertain the thought that the people of the North ought to submit to the proposition of allowing the South to recede without a struggle and yet I felt a deep drawing back and away from engaging in war. As I grew older I felt myself more and still more embarrassed on account of my lack of education. I knew I could not converse intelligently upon the topics of the day, for I must work and dare not loose time to hear all the papers read and I could not read well enough to read them' myself, and so I must be always behind the times. It has been said that “Thought will not work but in silence.”

#History of the Spencers

Written by Samuel Huddleston


My wife’s father James Johnson was born at Portsmouth, Ohio, May 12th, 1819. When a young man he went to Helena, Ark. where he was converted and joined the Methodist Episcopal Church and not long afterwards he was licensed to preach. About this time Luzena, daughter of Rozel Spencer came with her parents from Lewisville, Henry Co., Indiana and settled at the same place. The Spencers were Methodists and Luzena was a young convert. James Johnson and Luzena Spencer were married May 12th, 1844 . To them two daughters were born: Sarah Elizabeth March 7, 1845 and Mary N. August 4, 1847. James S. Johnson died of Typhoid fever Sept. 19, 1847. Luzena’s father having died previously and her mother had returned to Indiana, she to, now a widow hastened to follow her by steamer to Cincinnati and from there to Liberty, Union
Co., Indiana by public stage coach. Her baby died in her arms when she was nearing liberty.

On Oct. 12, 1850 Mrs. Johnson married Stephan M. Harrell and at the time of my visit to the Harrell settlement in and near Fairfield they lived on a farm near that town. I took little notice of Miss Johnson at this time for I was paying attention to another girl, a member of my own church and we would have married if her people had not separated us on account of my poverty and their dislike for my mother. Then while I was in the Army fighting for the preservation of our dear old Flag I was induced by a dear lady cousin of my Mother that I first met at the time of my visit in this settlement persuaded me and Miss Johnson to enter into correspondence for pass time and this correspondence brought about our acquaintance which ripened into Matrimony and we were united in marriage on May 12, 1866 at the house of the brides mother at Blooming Grove, Ind.

Many were the people that knew this lady from her childhood who told us that she was one of the first ladies of her circle of acquaintance; a lady loved by all who knew her. She admitted that it was the spirit of loyal patriotism that drew her sympathy to me and it was my letters portraying my devotion to my country, to my Christian experience and the unselfish tone of all my letters that made it easy for me to win her love for me .

We commenced our exchange of letters while I was Chief Nurse in Hospital No. 13. Nashville, Tennessee where I entered a very sick soldier with fever and when I commenced to recover the Surgeon perceiving my skill as a nurse held me there for one year. First as a common assistant, then as a special helping cases of wounded, then in cases of amputation of limbs and then as Chief nurse in charge of all the wounded and then he gave me the special care of all cases of gangrene . This last charge was given me because I never had a case of that common and dreadful wound disease contracted under my care, a disease that came from unclean dressing of wounds.

He was mustered out June 26, 1865. On May 12, 1866, Mr. Huddleston was united in marriage with Miss Sarah E. Johnson of Blooming Grove, Franklin County. It is stated they at once settled in Dublin where they have had their residence continuously to the present-time. Both have been for many years active and influential members of the M. E. Church, Mr. Huddleston having filled almost every position in connection with the administration of the affairs of the congregation to which he belonged. He entertained radical views in the temperance question and in politics was a Prohibitionist.

Mr. Huddleston was in many ways a remarkable man. His early educational advantages were quite limited and when he had grown to manhood could scarcely read or write. However through persistent effort, and the aid of his faithful wife, he finally acquired a fair education, although at an age when most men under like circumstances would have abandoned the undertaking. He was of a literary turn of mind and contributed somewhat extensively to the local papers and other periodicals. Several years ago he wrote "Footprints of the Huddleston Family," and later published a book of original poems.
 
Just prior to his death he completed an extensive history of the Huddleston family, the manuscript of which is now in the hands of Hon. George Huddleston, member of Congress for the Birmingham District, Alabama. He had long been a member of the Indiana Historical Society and had gathered much important data touching on the early settlement, growth and development of the county.

The children of Samuel Brown and Sarah E. Huddleston are:

#Andrew Jackson Smith , M.D.
H U S B A N D O F L U L U H U D D L E S T O N

In many respects the history of the life of the subject of this article is remarkable and extremely interesting.	It will be plainly apparent to the reader that he is a man of strong personality, having the courage of his convictions and daring to do what he believes to be right, under all circumstances.

He is of German parentage. His ancestors spelling the family name Schmidt. He was born near Cape Hatteras, on board the good ship Kaiser Wilhelm, December 31, 1836, while his parents were on their way to the United States form the Fatherland. They settled upon a large plantation in McLean County, Kentucky, and the father who was a physician, and possessed great ability, became one of the prominent citizens of that community. He owned a numbers of slaves, and about the time of the trouble which was brewing between the north and the south over this disputed question, he sympathized with the south, and served his country as a member of congress, from the sixth congressional district of Kentucky. He died in 1876, when in his eighty-seventh year, his death being the result of an accident which he had sustained.	His wife, who died in 1894, lived to the advanced age of ninety-eight years.

Strange as it appears, Dr. Andrew J. Smith was totally opposed to the principles of slavery from his boyhood, thought the sentiments of his family were at variance with his own. In his young days he assisted many a poor slave to make his escape by means of the “underground railway,” and finally his life was threatened so seriously that he concluded that “discretion is the better part of valor,” and he left home. Going to New Orleans, he entered the United States Navy as a sailor, and served for three years, a most eventful period in his life, as he visited many of the important ports of the world. He was in Japan at the time that Commodore Perry made the famous treaty of 1853. Prior to which year that nation had for centuries been closed to all commercial relations with other countries.

Upon his return to Kentucky, his increasing sympathy for the slaves was too plainly evinced for his personal safety, and during the opening days of the war of the Rebellion, when sectional excitement was at its height, he tore down a confederate flag which had been raised in his neighborhood. For this exploit he was pursued and captured and probably would have been shot had he not managed to escape in disguise.

Reaching Louisville, he crossed the Ohio river and enlisted as a private in Company F, Fifth Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers, being accredited to Butler County, Kentucky. This body of troops was better known as the Louisville Legion. Company F was commanded by Captain J.E. VanSant, and the regiment had Colonel L.H Rosseau at its’s head. Assigned to Rosseau’s brigade, McCook’s division of the twentieth Army Corps, which served in the army of the Cumberland, doing valiant service in many of the important battles and campaigns of the war.

Among the numerous battles in which Dr. Smith participated were the following named: Bowling Green, February 15, 1862: Shiloh, April 6-7, 1862; and Stone River, December 31, 1862; Tullahoma, July 1, 1863: Chickamauga, September 19-20: Brown’s Ferry, October 27; Chattanooga, November 25; Mission Ridge and Blaines’ Cross Roads, December 16, 1863; Buzzards’ Roost February 25-27, 1864; Peach Tree Creek; Jonesboro; Rocky face Ridge, May 5-9, 1974; Resaca, May 13-17, 1864; and then in quick succession came Dallas, Kenesaw Mtn, Pine Mtn, Pine Knob, Golgotha, Lattimers, Mill’s Noonday creek, Prairie Springs and many others. In fact the fighting was almost continuous during many months of 1864, and in September of that year, by reason of the expiration his three years term of service, Dr. Smith was honorably discharged at Louisville, Kentucky.

In January, 1865, however he re-enlisted, becoming a member of Company A, Fourth Regiment of the United State Veteran Infantry under the command of Captain Montgomery and Colonel Wood. He was soon promoted to a captaincy and served with his regiment, under General Phil Sheridan in the famous Shenandoah campaign. Subsequently he was sent with the regiment to Washington, and after the assassination of Lincoln they were assigned to guard the prison in which Payne, Spangler, Dr. Mudd and Mrs. Surratt, fellow conspirator of Booth were confined. Later they were detailed to accompany Dr. Mudd and Spangler to Tortugas Island where they were sentenced to imprisonment and returning to Washington, the regiment witnessed the execution of the other assassins.

In 1861, Dr. Smith graduated in the Kentucky School of Medicine, and at the battle of Shiloh he was detailed as assistant surgeon in the field hospital. In the fall of 1865, he was examined and appointed assistant surgeon in the United States Army, being assigned to duty with the Fifth Regiment of the United States Cavalry, a position he filled, with great credit, for five years. During the war, he was wounded several times, once at Stone River, the last day of 1862, and at Mission Ridge, Liberty Gap and Kenesaw Mountain. He still carries some Confederate lead in his body, and has never fully recovered from his honorable wounds.

In 1870 Dr. Smith established an office for practice in Tell City, Indiana, where he remained for twelve years; in the meantime taking a course in the Eclectic Medical Institute, at Cincinnati, where he graduated in 1872. In 1882 he removed to Indianapolis, a wider field of action, and there was successfully engaged in the practice for nine years, during which period he pursued a course of study and was graduated in the Central College of Physicians and Surgeons at Indianapolis in 1886.

Since 1891 he has been a resident of Metamora Indiana, where he enjoys a fine practice, and has won a well merited place among the leading members of his profession in this section of the state. He is considered an authority on medical jurisprudence and in September 1889, prepared and read before the Franklin County Medical Society an original article on “Expert Testimony,” which has commanded wide attention and favorable comment.

On the 30th of September, 1889, Dr. Smith married Miss Lulu Huddleston, who’s father, Samuel Huddleston was a member of the Indiana 84th Regiment during the war of the Rebellion, and now is a citizen of Dublin, Indiana. The Doctor and wife have two promising sons: Adkison John and Noble Gordon Smith. Some time ago, Mrs. Smith took a regular course of medical study and training and since then has been associated with her husband in practice rendering him invaluable assistance. They have legions of Friends in various parts of this and other states.

#The Cox’s and Cadwalladers


Edith’s mother was Martha Cox and her father was Isaac Cadwallader.	Martha’s father was John Cox and her mother was Jane Thompson.	The Cox’s had settled in Madison Twp, Franklin County, Ohio.	John Cox served as Justice of the Peace and helped to settle this township.		The Cox’s and Cadwallader ‘s are 2 other Quaker lines that Leah Huddleston and I have traced.	Isaac was in the Civil war as Edith states and her parents were married in Ohio after the civil war.	I wish I could have found Isaac in a census record in 1870. The obit of Ida Cadwallader Hearn says that her parents brought her to Jay County when she was a child. The first wife we believe to be Sarah Jane Pennock, the Pennock’s were another Quaker line.	Isaac and Martha certainly did not continue on in the Quaker faith. Several family members on this line became Methodists.	The obituaries that I found on Edwin shows that he was a faithful Methodist to the end. He died in Ridgeville, Randolph, Indiana in 1938.	This obit was a very precious piece of evidence, corroborating the evidence to the Hearn’s, and Huddleston’s & Pennock family members.

JOHN COX


Ridgeville Times, 1938
Edwin A. Cadwallader, son of Isaac Dillon Cadwallader and Jane Pennock was born in Jefferson County, Ohio. February 19, 1958.	Departed this life at his home in Ridgeville, Indiana, March 27, 1938 aged 80 yrs and 1 month and 8 days.	Early in his life he was converted and united with the M.E. church and remained true to his faith til taken from labor to reward.

I will post here the information that was researched by someone else on the Cadwallader name and information regarding John Cadwallader from whom we are descended.	None of this has been verified by me.
The following was excerpted exactly and in its entirety from the article The Descendants of John Cadwallader by Le Roy Linn.

The Descendants of John Cadwallader
Ancient and Medieval Wales


Remarks in [ ] added by Andrew L. Moore

The first known inhabitants of Wales were Iberians [the present day Iberian Peninsula contains the countries of Portugal and Spain], who were short, dark and of Spanish-Portuguese extraction. When the Celts, who were from northern Europe and were fair, not necessarily fair haired but of fair skin and tall, invaded northern Wales, they forced the Iberians into the southern part of Wales and by utilizing the almost impenetrable mountain fastnesses strategically, they were able to resist invasions of the Romans, Angles, Saxons and Normans. There the royal tribes of Wales lived for centuries and maintained the most pure blood of the Celtish stock of Great Britain and Europe. The extravagantly scenic grandeur of northern Wales lends itself to the mystic part of the royal heritage of Wales. There are still traces of the Iberian element in the peoples of southern Wales and the later emigrants of Wales to the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.

Northwestern Wales is considered a region of fabulous beauty with its mountains, lakes and ancient castles. It is referred to as the fabled land of song and story, only the fables were more truth than fiction. Wales still keeps its bright flame of individuality. Its people are poetic and musical - especially given to choir singing. One of the last ancient kings was Cadwaladr of Gwynedd, Cadwalader Ap Cadwallon (Lloyd vol. 1, p. 230) "After the fall of Cadwallon, the house of Cunedda was represented by his son Cadwaladr, who was king among the Britians in the days of Oswy of Northumbria. None of his deeds are recorded yet he must have been a figure of some distinction, for the bands of later ages regarded his name as one to conjure with.….He died in the great plague of 664" "the church of Eglays Ael or Llandawaldr in Anglesey claims him as its patron saint and founder, some two miles east from Abertfraw in Anglesey." On a modern map of Anglesey (part of northern Wales) is a small bay near Abertfraw called Portcadaladr.
 

Cadwalader or Cadwallader (encyclopedia of Names and Places) surnamed the "Blessed" died probably in 664 a British King. He was the son of Cadwallon, King of Gwynedd, whom he succeeded in 634. He obtained great fame by the heroic exploits which he performed in the defense of Wales against the Saxons and holds a high place in Welsh tradition and poetry. According to the prophecy of Merlin, he is one day to return to the world to expel the Saxons from the land. He came in time to be regarded as a saint, hence his surname the "Blessed". Undoubtedly many Cadwalladers today are descended from those ancient kings. The banner of king Cadwaladr was emblazoned with the red dragon, and even today Wales bears the red dragon on its heraldic symbol. The name CADWAL(L)ADER in Welsh means "Valiant in Battle" and rings with its Celtic sound.

The religion of ancient Celtic Wales was a nature religion conducted by their priests or leaders called Druids. When Christianity came in the sixth century, the Celtic Church was formed. That continued until after Rome set up its Pope-controlled Catholic Church. Roman Catholicism was resisted for a while but in 664 at the Syned of Whitby, the differences between the Celtic Church and the Roman Church were adjusted with Roman influence prevailing. Both Henry VIII and later Queen Elizabeth were instrumental in breaking the hold of Roman Catholicism and the Anglican Church was established and became increasingly more powerful.

In 1282 Edward I of England partially conquered northern Wales. He built the beautiful castle of Caernarvon. Here his son, Edward II the first English Prince of Wales, was born in 1284. Other English nobles built castles in the mountains round about. The Welsh were hightly rebellious and antagonistic to the English until the coronation of Henry VII. His father, the Welsh born Owen Tudor, married the widow of Henry V of England. Their son Henry Tudor, after his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field, were he defeated Richard III, became King Henry VII in 1485. When he entered London for his coronation with the red dragon flag of Cadwaladr born before him, it was thought that Wales had recovered its independence again, but the Act of the Union of 1536 united Wales to England with only the graceful heritage of a Prince of Wales to soothe them. Since that time, the first born son of the English Kings has been called the Prince of Wales. The present Prince Charles of England was made Prince of Wales on July 1, 1969, at the castle of Caernarvon with much pomp and heraldry.

The Friends, or Quakers as they are popularly called, had their rise in the turbulent years of the English Commonwealth period (1642-1660). The founder of the movement was George Fox. He was a born leader and a spiritual genius and drew many groups to him who were eager for a more complete reformation of the Church. The movement spread in England in the face of fierce and brutal persecution, and from 1657 onward the Quakers sought refuge in America. William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, was one of the notable figures of the Society of Friends. The movement had spread to Wales, and because of the simplicity of the Faith, was adopted by many of the most educated and the highest gentry of the land. William Penn was himself an aristocrat, who was practically disinherited by his family for becoming a Quaker, as most of the English Quakers were of the middle class.

William Penn was friendly with the Indians, bargained with them and took possession of Pennsylvania, where he started his "Holy Experiment". He was very pleased to have many Welsh Quakers from the highest social order to contact him to purchase 30,000 acre to settle in eastern Pennsylvania. The earliest settlers of the Welsh Tract were peers of William Penn and planned to establish an exclusive Welsh Quaker Barony, but the experiment failed. Later they bargained with Penn for 20,000 acres to add to the tract and more Welsh Quakers came and later some Welsh Presbyterians and Baptists. The towns in this great Welsh Tract - Bryan Mawr, Gwynedd, Bala Cynwood, Berwyn, Wyncote, Chalfonte, Malvern and Merion [all in eastern Pennsylvania - near Philadelphia] - are Celtic in sound and origin.

For many years after Great Britain and many European nations used surnames, Wales still used only one name, and the term "son of" was written "ap" with always the son's name first and continuing back through the father as John ap Hugh ap Thomas. When Wales started using surnames, the same Cadwal(l)ader was always a given name or first name, and it was not used as a surname until after the immigrants landed in America. Mothers in Wales often named their sons Cadwal(l)ader in honor of King Cadwaladr just as they named sons Arthur after the fabled King Arthur of ancient Welsh fame. That is the reason it is practically impossible to trace the Cadwal(l)ader lineage back in Wales with any certainty. Dr. Rawlins Cadwallader in
 
his History said: "I have many Welsh parish records of births and deaths. They are impossible to trace as a family and I am perforced to start from four heads of families who came to Philadelphia. All four were Friends [Quakers], all four had well defined descendants, all four admitted relationship, and may have been cousins. The records of the original meetings in Wales under George Fox might clear it all up but I have not located them. They are probably lost." He goes on to say "There was a peculiar tradition in early Pennsylvania that the families were descendants of three brothers. It was wide-spread and undoubtedly referred to the three original Johns. Unfortunately, the early minutes are not complete. A more exhaustive search might add the missing proof but of this I am doubtful."

The three Johns that he is referring to are: John Calwalader of Merion and then of Philadelphia, John Cadwallader of Horsham and then of Warminster, and John Cadwalader of Randor. The fourth line is Robert Cadwallader or Cadwallader Roberts as he was later called. His male descendants carry the name Roberts. John Cadwalader of Philadelphia [PA] was from Bala, Merionethshire [Wales]; John Cadwalader of Horsham [PA] from Montgomeryshire [Wales]; John Cadwalader of Randor [PA] from Radnorshire [Wales]; and Cadwallader Roberts from Bala, Merionethshire [Wales]. These counties in Wales connect and are a small tract of some 15 miles by 45 miles. As there was much intermarriage between Quaker families both in Wales and the early United States, a certain amount of relationship would likely exist."

Taken from Rootsweb.com John Cadwalader
(All this information, much typed verbatim, comes from Le Roy Linn's article "The Descendants of John Cadwalader").

John was born circa 1676 in Montgomery Shire, Wales, United Kingdom. He was a minister among the Society of Friends (Quakers) and adhered to the Quaker calendar which began with March as the first month of the year. According to several sources, he emigrated from Wales to Pennsylvania in 1697. He married twice: (1) Mary Cassel on 28 May 1701 at the Abington Quaker Monthly Meeting in Abington, Montgomery Co PA, and (2) Margaret Peters on 29 Apr 1730. Margaret was a widow living in Warmister, PA at the time of her marriage to John. He conducted several missionary journeys - home and abroad and died 26 Sep 1742 in Tortola, West Indies. After John died, Margaret remarried a Rees Nancy and died in 1748 childless. She willed her estate to nephews, nieces and friends – but not to any Cadwaladers. Mary Cassel, John's first wife, was the daughter of Joannes and Mary Cassel. She died on 8 Nov 1728 and is buried in Horsham, Montgomery Co PA. Joannes was a Quaker and a weaver and one of the founders of Germantown, PA. He migrated from Kresheim in the Palatinate, High Germany to the United States on 20 Dec 1686. He had five children: Arnold, Peter, Elizabeth, Mary and Sarah. He died 17 Feb 1691 and is buried in Germantown, PA.

The following memorial to Mary (Cassel) Cadwalader was submitted by the Abington MM to the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in 1758: "On 8 Nov 1728 died Mary Cadwalader, the wife of John Cadwalader, deceased. She was appointed and Elder for Horsham Particular Meeting, and died in that station. She was inoffensive in Life and Conversation; discreet and careful in management of her husband's affairs when he was abroad in Truth's Service; aged near 50 years, was buried at Horsham."
According to Lee Roy Linn, the author of The Descendants of John Cadwalader, John and Mary lived at Horsham, PA on a tract of land acquired from Samuel Carpenter on 16 Dec 1702 which was next to the present Horsham MM (Quaker Monthly Meeting House) land. They were members of the Society of Friends at Abington PA. In 1714 John was instrumental in helping establish a small log meeting house at Horsham on 50 acres of land granted by the widow of Samuel Carpenter. The Horsham MM was a part of the Abington MM until it became large enough to establish itself as an independent Monthly Meeting.
The minutes of the Abington MM lists that in: 
1716 - John Cadwalader was appointed to visit families on a religious visit to New England. 
1719 - Certificate to visit Barbados but did not go at this time.
1721 - Certificate to visit Great Britain. 1724 - Certificate to visit Long Island.
1732 - Certificate to visit Great Britain and Ireland. 1740 - Certificate to visit Virginia and North Carolina.
1742 - Certificate to visit the Island of Tortola in the West Indies of the Caribbean Sea.

On 12 Aug 1742, John sailed from Philadelphia for the island of Tortola. He contracted "fever" and died there on 26 Sep 1742. He is buried on the island. By 1900, traces of the church's foundation were barely discernable and the graves of John and his fellow missionaries were also faintly evident.
Prior to his departure, John drew up a will (dated 30 Jul 1742) leaving his wife Margaret (Peters) Cadwalader all of the household goods, one gray house and one cow. His daughter-in-law Mary and grandson Isaac each received 5 pounds (British Pound Sterling). The balance of his estate was divided between his children: John, Jacob, Joseph, Benjamin, Sarah, Jane, Mary and Martha.

The following memorial to John Cadwalader was submitted by the Abington MM to the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in 1758: "Our friend John Cadwalader of Horsham, was convinced of the Principles of Truth when young; had a gift in the ministry bestowed on him in which he was serviceable; underwent many deep baptizing seasons, by which it is believed he was in good degree an overcomer. He traveled much in the exercise of his gift, having visited his Brethren in Truth's service in most, or all, the parts of this continent where Friends reside; and crossed the Seas twice to Europe on the same account; and once to the island of Barbados. He last visit was to the island of Tortola. He was taken indisposed on his passage thither before he landed, yet proceeded on the service he went up for the satisfaction of Friends there, but is distemper increasing upon him. He departed this life in Peace, on said Island of Tortola, on the 9 Sep 1742, aged near 66 years."

#THE EARLY LIFE OF EDITH HUDDLESTON SUMMERFRUIT

I was born January 4th 1873. My father was in the civil war. He had charge of the commissary Department and fed the soldiers well. He was well educated. He had been an orator, and when young, was called upon in many public meeting places to recite the Declaration of Independence.

He also impersonated Shakespeare plays. This is where I inherited my talent for acting. After the war, his trade was cabinet maker, finisher and sign painter. In those days, all such work was done by hand.

My mother was a woman of 40 when she married my father. He was a widower with three children. My mother was educated in all the rudiments of music while she lived in the home of a German professor for four years. On her 18th birthday her
 
father gave her a fine piano. It was a Knabe which was made in Baltimore. I still have that piano. Mother would never part with it under any circumstances. It is now 142 years old and will be left to my daughter, who is also a musician both in piano and violin. She has written several songs; both words and music. My mother was a wonderful woman. She never whipped or scolded me. She was always kind and loving. She taught me the right and wrong ways of life and I never disobeyed her counsel. She passed beyond at the age of 81. She was a wonderful, Christian example to me.

The first Christmas I remember was before my third birthday. It was a different Christmas from the Christmas of these days. My brothers planned it all. They found a tree from the woods and strung popcorn on it. We hung a few candles shaped like slipper boots and an angel. There were wax candles tied onto the tree, which we had to blow out for fear of fire. On
Christmas Eve, I was sitting on my father's lap in the next room warming my feet by an old fireplace when we heard a noise. "Listen," my father said, "I think I hear Santa's whistle." Then we heard it farther away. " I guess he's gone now, let's go in and see." I was thrilled at the sight. My faith in Santa Claus was established at this time. This simple child-like faith grew to a faith in God. A faith developed from not seeing, yet believing in his wondrous love and guidance through all the difficulties in life. (Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.)

I must give a few incidents of my child life to show that I was original in my ideas and my plan to carry them out. I remember at the age of five, my playmate took me to school to visit. On Friday they did recitations and when the teacher asked for volunteers I raised my hand to say, "I know a piece." "All right," she said, " Recite it, and I'll give you this big bouquet on my desk." I marched to the platform, put in plenty of gestures and expressions and got my bouquet. This was my first thrill of doing something important.

When I started school, they sang a song to anyone late. It was " A Tardy Scholar Is Your Name." I lived but a square away from school; but I waited until I heard the last bell ring, and then I'd run to school. By the time I arrived they were all in their seats, so they sang me this song. I'd sing the second verse and act like I was crying. "That is just the way, you see, always making fun of me."


When I was 9 years old, there was an announcement in the newspaper, about a lady to who was to speak at the Y.M.C.A. She was organizing a class in elocution, which was the name for dramatizations at that time. My mother took me to hear her. I was so interested, I wanted to speak to her, so I pulled at her dress as she passed my seat. She asked my mother, " What does your little girl want?" My mother was timid. "Oh," she said,
 
"my daughter is so interested, I would like for you to give her lessons. I am a music teacher, I don't get paid much. Her father died two years ago, but I will pay you as soon as I can." The lady held my hand. " Bless her heart, " she said, " you bring her to my apartment next week." She gave lessons free of charge to the children in her class that she saw had talent. She offered my mother $10 per week to let me travel with her, but my mother refused, for fear I might go wrong. I needed my mother's advice and love.

One more incident of my child life. A gentleman came to our city and advertised for 300 children to produce a Cantata. It was to be all singing and acting - representing spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I was at the age of 10 years. I tried out and my part was summer. We were girls on a picnic serving a widow lunch. There were faeries for spring, jolly imps for fall, snowstorms and trouble for winter. It was the finest home talent ever produced in our city in the best opera house. The manager wanted someone to recite the opening address. Some of the older girls came with their mothers to try out. I went to the manager afterwards and asked if I could try for the address. He looked me over and said, " You? All right, get up there and let me see what you can do." If I ever put my soul into my work it was now. My teacher had trained me well. I impersonated a street sweeper in New York. When I came back to my seat he said "I'll let you know later." We practiced for one week and on Saturday, at the last rehearsal, I asked the manager if he had decided who was to give the opening address. "Oh yes," he answered, " I wanted you from the first, but forgot to give you the part. It's very important as it describes the whole play and you cannot have it committed to memory by Monday, for the dress rehearsal." " Let me try" I said, "I'll do my best." I studied all day Sunday and was ready for the dress rehearsal on Monday. He said to speak it is just as I had studied it and if he had any changes he would tell me then. He said he wouldn't change it and it had never been given better by any child. When the curtain rolled, I was at the front with the entire cast in the rear- faeries, spirits, maids, flowers, fountains representing the Garden of Eden. This was my first start in the things I wanted to do in my life.

When I was 13, I was converted and joined the Methodist Church and lived to the best knowledge of right living. I attended all services of the church, I didn't go to dances or play cards. I was secretary of the band of hope, a temperance club. The president, a boy two years older, would ask to walk me home under his umbrella if it was raining. I never drank any intoxicating liquor and never smoked cigarettes. I often spoke for church entertainments and won medals in Demarest contests on temperance.

At 17, I dramatized Little Women from the book and produced it on the stage with my class in dramatic Art. It was a success. The life of the young people was so much different in my time. There were no moving pictures, and no drinking parties, the young folks have more temptation now. Girls run after men- there's too much petting and they think sex appeal means love but it doesn't last.

I had my first romance at 18 years of age at a church social. There was a spring carnival for the young folks. We girls were to trim a hat and make a bow tie for a boy out of the same material. They were to pick up the tie at the door and find our partner for the evening by matching the material on the hat. I wore a bonnet shaped with pink muslin and a large butterfly in the back. When I bowed the wings would flap up and down. I made a small butterfly tie. I spied my partner, but stayed in the rear. Finally he found me and exclaimed, "Oh, here is my butterfly." We spent an enjoyable evening and many evenings after. We had prayer meetings on Thursday at my home. On Friday evening we went driving and for walks in the park on Sunday afternoons. We had some good times. I liked him fine. He was from a fine family. His brother was a reporter for our paper. We had many things in common. I liked to talk to him about my work and what I wanted to do with my life. I intended to go to Indianapolis to train as a kindergarten teacher because I loved children and was interested in them. We had good times all summer; and, in the fall, he didn't want me to leave town, so he proposed marriage. I wasn't ready to give up my work as I wanted to make my life worthwhile- do something important- before I settled down to marriage, housekeeping and children. I felt that after marriage I would need to devote all my time to being a good wife and mother. It would be important for me to teach my children the ways of life- as my mother had taught me; and to remain at home and live the kind of example that I wished my children to live. My friend and I parted; not knowing what the future would be.

I entered the school for training. We took our lessons in the afternoon and taught classes in the mornings as dictated the day before. I won at "best for organization" and "holding children's attention." When I returned home, I taught the first kindergarten in the public schools of Richmond, Indiana. I taught a private class in my home in the afternoon. I did this for several years. I saw there was a need for a free kindergarten in the extreme west end of the city as well as the North, so I had tables and benches made by donation and held classes in the basement of the old church where I first went to Sunday school. This was the year 1880. The city furnished street car tickets for the children as I lived in the east end of town. I didn't expect any pay but the church people made me a purse of $50- which was a nice sum in those days.

I loved my work and was happy to be doing something for others as well. Then I began to think; "I'm getting older, almost 24 years of age." Girls who were not married at 25 were considered an old maid. I didn't want to be thought of as an old maid; so I thought I'd better find a husband. I decided that he must be a man from a good family, have a secure business, must not drink liquor or use tobacco.

I met a gentleman, who was a student at the Medical College; but he was a jealous person. We were at a lodge social and I happened to speak to a friend I knew. When we returned home that night he said, "You did something I couldn't stand. You spoke to a man and smiled where everyone saw you. They knew you were engaged to me." I said, "Well, that is nothing more than I would do as if we were married. I'll always speak to old friends." We broke up after that.

When I went to Earlham College to take oratory and literature, I met the nephew of the President of the college. He was my instructor. All of our conversation was strictly literary during class. He was educated, a musician, and an elocutionist. One could hardly believe that he could be so foolish, but when studies were over, and we were at my home, in the moonlight, he would look up at the stars and say, "Do you love that special star?" "Why yes," I'd say, "I love all of God's wonderful universe." " But I mean that one." He would point up to the sky. "Sure," I'd say. Then he would remark, " I wish I was that star." I thought that was so silly. He told me his family was English, and were very reserved. He said his mother lived in New York. His grandparents lived in Michigan and he made his home with his grandparents. His family planned that he and his cousin should be married to keep the property and family tradition; but he didn't like the idea. He said I was just what I was and wasn't trying to cover up anything. That was what he liked about me: I was an open book. I wasn't interested in his theory, but all my friends said, "Look at his standing, his education.	You shouldn't turn him down." "Well," I thought, "Perhaps I shouldn't."

He planned that we would take a camping trip to see the lakes and go to New York to visit his mother before our wedding. His sister, his cousin and wife were our chaperones. We rented a cottage for one week. We had a fine time fishing, boating, and eating. When the week was over, we wanted to stay longer but he neglected to extend the time. Another couple had rented the cottage so we needed to vacate. He sat outside the cottage and said, "What are we going to do?" "Get out, of course." I said, "I'm ready to go home." His grandmother said, " I'm glad Robert is going to marry someone that has such push about them, he's always depending on someone." He said he wished someone would send him a hundred pounds. I didn't know how much that was. He had a chance to teach literature where he had graduated but failed to apply in time. He wrote me we would have to live in Michigan in his grandmother's home. It was all too much, so I answered I would release him from our engagement. As I saw the situation, I would have to do the pushing, leave my dear old mother, and be with people I didn't understand. It was not worth getting a husband. I didn't love him. In fact, I'd thought real love was just in storybooks. I certainly hadn't found a man that was intended for me.

Well, when you least expect it, the magic happens. One of my pupils lived in the country. At the close of the school year her parents had an entertainment and I was asked to recite. On the night of the entertainment, the mother came to me saying a young man, who worked for her daughter's grandparents, was coaching the play. "My," I thought, "Isn't he a handsome man." When the show was over, I saw him watching me. I was also watching him. My pupil introduced me to all the boys, but didn't introduce me to the one person I really wanted to meet (In those days we would be very much out of place if we spoke to a gentleman without an introduction.) Finally, he came up to where we were standing and so she had to introduce us. [This was Walter Murray Huddleston.] Later in the evening, when I was alone, he came to me saying, "I'm glad I met you and would like to see you home." "No," I said, " I came with a group and must go home with them to Pearl's house." He said, "Can you stay a few days? There is going to be a reunion here in two more days." I told him I wasn't invited. "Well," he said, "I want to see you again." I didn't tell the girls that he talked to me; but when we got home they said "Why not stay a few days with us and attend the reunion?" "Well," I said, "I might." I'm having a good time."

I went to the reunion, but didn't see Murray anywhere until I was on the platform reciting "Them Oxen." He was 6 ft. 2 in. and stood out standing on the back bench. When I saw him, it shocked me so I forgot my lines, but recovered so that no one noticed. After the program, he walked up to me and said, "Well, you got to come. I'm glad." I said, "I'm thirsty, is there any water out here?" "Yes," he said, "Over there in the barrel." He didn't offer to get me a drink and I thought, "You independent guy!" Some other boys came over and asked me to have some ice cream. I refused, then he came up and said, "There is a church social at Whitewater tonight. I'll take you girls over there and give you all you can eat. There will be lots of ice cream, watermelon, candy, and anything you want." We went; and a good many people we had met at the reunion were there. They kept yelling, "I'll never forget 'Them Oxen," which is what I had recited at the picnic. Pearl and I began talking about making a trip up north to Winchester, Mt. Pleasant and Ridgeville, Indiana. Murray suggested we borrow his pony and buggy. " She is gentle and you should have fun." He would go to Alba, on horseback, and we were to send him a note when we returned. So it was settled. We took our trip; and when we got to Alba, sure enough, there he was. He drove us home to Pearl's folks leading the horse behind. It was quite late when we got there and I thought he wouldn't come in, but he said, "A few minutes to say good night and I enjoyed the trip." After he said goodnight he whispered to me, " Will you walk as far as the gate with me? I want to ask some questions." "You already said good night," I replied; but he said "Please, it's only a few steps." As soon as we were alone, he said, "You think I'm going with Pearl." I nodded. Everywhere we'd gone, she'd said, "This pony and buggy belongs to my boyfriend." Murray laughed. "She is only a school girl. I kid her a lot, just in fun; but she's too young for me. I like an older girl who is more settled. If you stay until tomorrow, we are threshing at her grandfather's and they will have a fine dinner. I'll drive you to town in the evening." Well, I stayed; and as I stood on the porch and watched him on the thresher all covered with dirt, I thought, "Isn't he handsome?" Here I was falling in love with a poor farm hand and didn't know him or his people or what his habits were. Strange isn't it?

The drive home that evening was wonderful. He told me about his people who lived in Dublin, Indiana. They were Christians, which made me happy. He said he left home to get a start for himself, but wasn't making much money. Farmhands worked very cheap those days, but got plenty to eat.

From that time on, I thought a lot about Murray. It seemed he was interested in my work and liked my mother. (Mother and I lived alone.) He came down about three evenings a week. I told him about my life; that I had been engaged twice, but could not go through with it. He said he wasn't going to give me a chance to turn him down, he'd marry me first. He said" You don't want to be an old maid, do you?" It 's so different when it's true love- like God is in the union; and then it makes no difference about the high standards we set. There is only one sentimental, true love. There are other loves, such as respect, goodness, kindness; but when you're older, true love hits you harder. I am convinced about true love. Murray and I were married in three months; and I thought I knew him.

Well, we didn't have a big wedding with the fancy clothes I wanted when I was younger. We were married at home. No one was present but the preacher and my dear mother. It seemed so solemn, I cried in my flowers. We drove to his father's home in the same little buggy and pony we rode in when we met. His parents, brothers, and cousins were all there to meet us. My father-in-law had a long white beard like my dearly departed father, and I told him, "It's like getting my daddy again." "God bless you, daughter," he said, "We love you like our own." Then I said, "I want to start our first night together with family prayer." He said, "We will do that. We have neglected it lately." He got down the old Bible, read a chapter and had prayer. We stayed one week, then went down the hills to a little town called Metamora where his sister and husband lived. They were both physicians. We stayed a week, then returned to his father's home for Thanksgiving. We all went to church and father Huddleston said, as we walked along, "We're proud of our children." After the services Walter and I traveled to our own home in the city. I had receptions given me by my relatives and friends; one from my drama class, one from my kindergarten class. I got some beautiful presents. My husband promised to join the church the first Sunday and he did so. We were very happy.

Why does sorrow come so soon to blight the happiness? The very next year our baby was born dead. He looked just like his father. We had his picture taken. He weighed 10 lbs. When they buried the baby, I was so grief stricken they thought I wouldn't live. Murray begged me to live for him as he had already given up his baby. He brushed my hair and said he didn't want to lose one hair of my head. I had given up all my public work when I married- as I thought my place was in the home; but without our first child, I was lost. I couldn't content myself, but Murray and I had each other. Then one more year, another baby, a little girl. My husband had just gone to the shop to treat the boys to cigars, when I had to call him home. We had our daughter only one day. She cried for an hour, then was quiet. When I turned the covers down, she was blue. The doctor said it was her heart. " Oh," I cried to Murray, "You wanted me to live for you and I did. I could have died then; and, now, I can't go on living. I've brought more trouble for you and myself." Murray said "Don't talk that way, dear. We will try not to have any more children, just go places together and have a good time." Well, he tried to make me happy, but still I was not satisfied. I loved children. He said, "You cry whenever you see baby clothes on the line." Well, "I said, you are not a mother who has lost children." Three years went by. I loved my husband, but there was something missing- the love of a child.

Finally, another baby girl came to us; and everything was all right this time. I had a fear that she would be taken away if she slept too long, so I would wake up to see if she was all right. After the delivery I had to have help until I got stronger. My husband's foreman said he could spare one of his girls to help me out until I was able. Betty was a jolly girl and made things cheerful; but I dismissed her when I was able to take over.

About this time, Murray said his shop work didn't agree with him, so he traveled out of town organizing lodges. I got so lonesome for him; but I had my mother and my baby. He would come home on weekends. In two year’s I was expecting again. Murray was home when I delivered. The doctor said, " You sure had a hard delivery." this time it was a boy. " Oh, Daddy, " I said to Murray, "Kiss me. I've given you the son you wanted."

When my son was two months old, I still had not taken him out. My husband said, "I must go early to the Pocahontas Lodge tonight, there is a committee meeting." Well, after he was gone, I got lonely as I had been close to home so long. Murray was out for a good time; and all at once I made up my mind. I thought, " I'm going to the lodge tonight and take my baby." I left our little girl with my mother. I put the baby in his cab, wheeled him 10 squares, and then up the steps of the lodge to the second floor. I was given out from the trip; and, so, waited in the hall to rest. I heard women's voices when I opened the door of the lodge and wheeled in the cab. There were seven women bowing and talking. This was the committee meeting he told me about. It was early and no men had yet arrived. My husband asked why I came. I said I wanted to be where he was. Everyone got quiet and no one seemed to know what to do. "Well," Murray said, "Since you are here, you can play the piano for our drill." So I did. I hadn't been to the lodge for a long time and did not know the new members. After the lodge meeting everyone went out into the dance hall while I sat at the piano.	A man walked up to me and said, "My wife and your man are having fun. Let us promenade too." I jerked away and said, "I do not know you." "Oh," he said, " I'm a member." That's the way people act when men and women meet, but I was never used to that. When the party broke, my husband walked to the door and said, "Who all is going my way? Come on." I said, "I believe I'm going your way and here is your baby. I wheeled him up here, you can wheel him back." The foreman's girl, Betty, the one that had stayed with me, came along with us too; but since she lived farther away than we did, Murray offered to walk her home. I waited for him to return. I looked out the upstairs window for a long time. Finally, I saw my husband and this girl turn west toward her home. Where had they been? Could the rumor that someone told me about her be true? I sat there and waited for what seemed forever. I became numb. I couldn't move. Then I saw Murray walking slowly homeward- his head down. I waited and waited. Surely he will come into our room, I thought, but he didn't. I was exhausted, but crawled to the stairs and down to the living room. There he sat; tears rolling down his cheeks. "Oh," I cried, "What is the matter?" He looked up and exclaimed, "I'm in trouble."	"Tell me what it is." He replied,
 
"It's my trouble, not yours." "Well, my dear," I said, "If you're in trouble, I am too." "Tell me about it perhaps I can help." "No, no." " He said, "it's my trouble." He wouldn't tell me.

I heard that Betty had gone to her aunt's on a visit. My husband regularly ate in a restaurant in town and did not come home for all of his meals. Then, one day, he didn't return home at all. The next thing I knew I had a letter from him. " Dearest," he wrote, "I love you, but I'm not worthy to live in your home. Please forgive me. As soon as I get settled I'll send money for the children." Oh, I was frantic. I called my doctor. He said, "He can't get a divorce and don't give him one." My father-in-law came to see me and said, "Darling daughter, Murray couldn't live up to your standard. Don't give him a divorce and he will come back." I almost lost my mind. Why must this happen to us? We were so happy together. People seemed like pictures to me, passing to and fro. I was under the doctor's care. Betty's father came to me and said, "My daughter has left her aunt's home and has gone with your husband. I am sorry. We were brothers in the lodge. Betty knows better- she is past 20 years of age. She has already wrecked three homes; your home, my home, and also her own home. If her husband could find Murray he would kill him." Betty's father thought they would be back, but Murray and Betty went to a town in Arkansas, named Mark Tree. This was a town that was so swampy the houses were built on stilts. Betty and Murray both came down with yellow fever and were taken to a Catholic hospital. Murray died that night. He had been gone but four months.

An obituary was printed in our newspaper, and his clothes were sent to his father. I wanted to know the facts, so I wrote to the hospital and sent his photo. I asked if such a man on that date had died. I told them that I was his legal wife. (He had given them his middle name.) I got a return answer saying that it was true, that he had a heart attack, and they had not known what to do after his death. The report from the hospital said his body had been given to the Redmen Lodge for burial. This was all I knew for some time. All I could think was, "Why must I bear this burden?"

One day the phone rang. The voice said, "This is Betty. I am home and I must see you. Father will not let me leave the place. I have something important to say." She met me at the door and put her arms around me.	"I can't go on living, unless you forgive me. My father said the wages of sin is death. I didn't die but I suffered death. Murray's gone to meet his God. " I said, "You haven't got him and neither have I. It's no use to hold a grudge. I'll forgive you. If we don't forgive, how can we be forgiven?" So we cried it out together. The hardest thing I had to do in my Christian life was to forgive the one who wrecked my home. I asked her, "Tell me if he ever regretted taking that step?" "It was all my fault," she said. I worked in that restaurant. I told him we had the name, why not the game; but we left town because he was afraid of my father. After we left Murray would walk the floor, curse me and say, ''If it weren't for you, I'd be with my wife and children "He hated me. God knows, I paid dear for my sin."

It's been many years since all this happened. I am now 79; but it breaks my heart to recall it. If I live one more year, I would like to go to New York and take part in the program, "Life Begins at 80," and give my old time recitations, read the poems I have written, and tell what I think about the world today.

I am now 82 years old. God has blessed my family. I won out over this heartache through faith and prayer.	I now have a modern home, still do Christian work and am looking for the coming of our Savior, when we will not be married nor given in marriage. We will be with our loved ones and have peace and plenty.	There will be no more sorrow or tears. We will be one united family. There will be no more war when our Savior takes control.	Pardon my mistakes and writing. I am old and get nervous. God has been with me and will call me home some day to live forever with my Lord.
 
 
 
#THE LIFE HISTORY OF HOWARD N. HUDDLESTON


Richmond, Indiana, was my birth place on June 18, 1902. I have no memory of anything previous than at the age of one year, my story therefore begins here. I was born far before the medical practice of Cesarean birth, and my mother, Edith Karen Cadwallader Huddleston, who was not over five feet tall and having small bone structure, was in labor with me for over three days. After my arrival, Dr. Blossom advised that I would have to be layed on my left side to live. My mother took this advice for she said she had gone back to the crib many times day and night.

While I was yet in diapers and crawling, my mother told the story of when I had come up missing, and upon searching for me she said she heard a noise in the stairway. So opening the door at the base of the staircase, she found me about half way up the stairs with a paint brush and I was putting it in my mouth and trying to paint the risers of the steps.

Of course without realization, at the age of less than one, I now count it most Important for a happening which was made so vivid in my mind. My father, Walter Murray Huddleston, who had for the first, and I know now, the last time; walked in from the alley entrance into where my mother, my sister Gertrude, and I were seated at breakfast in that small kitchen of a big double house on D Street in Richmond. He made a most impressive event as he picked me up from my highchair and thrust me above his head and caused my feet to touch the ceiling. I can still visualize his face as I then looked down at him. I can remember the thrill when he thrust me so high it took my breath away. I still remember the color of the walls and ceiling to be a light green. I know now that this was his good-bye. For he then left us; mother, sister, myself and my grandmother Cadwallder who was then living with us.

This made a decided change in my life, now looking back, for my mother had not been really close to me now, and I saw very little of her from then on. My grandmother Cadwallader was taking care of me and my sister Gertrude. Gertrude was two years older than me, being the first of the three children born before me, a boy and girl who died at birth.

I also recall having suffered a displaced arm at the elbow as my sister attempted to pull me up from the floor. It had to be reset by a doctor.

About the next thing most outstanding in memory, was the big four-wheeled carriage that my grandmother had several times put me in and would always ask where I wanted to go. Now, I had not walked, and I was just learning to talk and my answer to her had always been,”See ‘chine.” Meaning I would like to go again just across the street to the freight yard, which was a very short distance from the old Garr Scott Factory where they build the old threshing machines. They were pained red with the trimming and the lettering a bright yellow. These colors were the reason for my desire to go and see and I was never content until I had reached out and placed my hand on the painted surface. Looking back at the many things like unto this, I have become quite certain that the artist is truly born to be.

One evening, my Uncle Frank Huddelston, my father’s brother, who resided in Richmond at the time, passed by our small front yard and asked me the question, “what do you think of your new dad?” I’m sure that I was no more than three years old then.	My mother had been entertaining a Mr. Ambrose F. Summerfruit, who later did become my step-father. But in answer to my uncles question, I remarked, “Well, they aren’t married yet.”

At the most likely age of about three and a half to four years old, they started me in a kind of kindergarten which was being held in the Starr School just at the top of the hill across E. Street and the corner of Ninth.	I
 
remember being quite content when the teacher passed out a little dab of putty to everyone there, and showed us how to roll it in our hands into a ball about the size of a walnut. She then furnished us color and I remember painting mine a bright yellow. Then the teacher thought we needed some exercise and she told us to stand up and take up our chairs, which were quite heavy; for they were made from hickory wood and a cane bottom. We were supposed to pick these chairs up and march around the room. I refused, and did not march with them. I sat in my chair and watched the rest of them who were bigger than me. I still recall seeing the hickory chairs after I had gown up; for there were two of these same chairs in my own home.

Ambrose Summerfruit came several times to our home with the effort to win my sister and me over. He would bring his big bicycle and seat us one at a time, on to the handlebars and take us for a ride. I don’t recall that I ever enjoyed any part of it. A short time later, my mother placed me in the same carriage I had spoken about before, and pushing the carriage they, mother and Mr. Summerfruit, walked across the Doran Bridge which hovered over a portion of the Garr Scott building. They had bought me a small cap which I had taken quite a fancy to. It was light yellowish brown, imitation leather, with a green cloth shading under the bill. And as we started to cross the bridge, a puff of wind blew my cap off and over the side it went. I guess I set up quite a howl of disappointment, yet I was somewhat comforted when he promised that when it was light he would go and find it, which he did. I placed my confidence in him for the first time and I thought he was a pretty good guy.

I don’t recall any marriage ceremony, but I’m sure there was one. I do remember an evening when a spring wagon which was drawn by a single black horse, they called Old Bob, came to our home. I remember seeing grandmother, where we left her at the house, seated by the old base burner. Mother and my new step father started with a few small furnishings out to the country place, where I was raised. The house was just about four hundred yards down stream from the little saw mill pond owned by a Mr. Miller, which later became Richmond’s Glen Miller Recreation Park. I was totally bewildered about where we were going and as the horse went along, it gradually became dark. As I laid looking up at the sky, I noticed the moon which appeared to be moving; I spoke up saying, “The moon is moving!” I remember how my mother laughed.


I must have been asleep when we arrived at the big ten room house. I had been carried in and put to bed on a cot which was very thinly padded, but I slept through the night. Upon waking quite early in the morning, I crawled out of my bed and experienced the surprise and terrible feeling of being totally forsaken. The room was completely bare other than the cot. I was as naked as a Jay-bird. I went out through the big double doors only to find another big empty room.	And on into another, also being completely void of anyone to console me. I guess I will never forget that which seemed to be a tragedy. Finally, I heard a noise and some voices. I opened another door into a very small room more or less a vestible directly off of a high back porch; An entrance to a staircase which led to the basement.	There my sister and mother sat having breakfast.

My mother was inclined to show partiality to my sister, Gertrude. I t seems that even at that age, about four, I was able to observe that I was anything else than the apple of her eye. I don’t think I will forget how she made a dress covered with the gold stars she had hand made, concentrating so much on how she would present Gertrude as one of the dancers on the big stage of the Colosseum; on Ninth Street in Richmond, which burned in a or around 1925. This is where my mother had many times put on her talents in Elocution which she taught. On this same stage; an outstanding happening occurred which I shall never forget. My mother had made a kite and had drilled me in a performance which I was to take this kite and in running out onto the stage, I was to call out: “March comes with wind and noise, Here’s a kite for all the boys.”
I guess I resented any thought of giving it to all the boys, for I felt it was mine. I deliberately refused and try as she may, I would not say even one word. She then, with her very strong voice, took the kite and dragged me across the stage and holding the kite, she called out the line. After that I was total let down in her mind.	In other words, most conclusively, it has been found that in my horoscope which declares that one who is born in my period; is seldom to be understood.

In getting back to the place where I was raised by my step-father. The big house had previously been occupied by a family by the name of Edsal. It was located nearby a small pond fed by the stream from the	mill pond and at that time was mainly used as an ice pond, for on the bank just above it had been erected a large store house used for storing ice. This was the only ice furnished to the town prior to the ice manufacturing plant promoted by Mathers Brothers Ice and Coal, located on F Street, which had become necessary after this big ice store house had burned down. When this fire occurred, I was at the age of about five or six. This fire was the first I had ever witnessed and I thought the whole world was on fire. I became frantic and I still recall my terrible fear.

One day, early in the spring, my sister, in play placed a rope around my neck and under my arms and said, “Let’s play horse.” After quite a run, it broke loose with a spring shower which was shortly over, and being somewhat fatigued and more than likely thirsty. There came, what appeared to our young minds, a stream down through what had been used as a cow pasture. My sister said, “Look at the stream, let’s have a drink.” We both drank and within twenty one days, which is the incubation period for typhoid, we had both developed the fever. Within that period we had been put to work, doing cleaning and raking the yard. Not knowing really what was coming on to me, I recall being quite chilled. I put on an old over-coat of my mothers, and I remember going into the wood shed which had been used to saw stove wood. In this shed there was an old fashioned saw buck stradling badly cut and chopped log where many limbs had been severed with the ax. I had quite often entered just to go in with a hammer, for I had found that I could make many different tones on the cross cut saw on the side of the building. But this time, I entered under the effect of the fever and chills. As I opened the door, this chopping log seemed to beckon me among the chips and rested my head in the great gap which had been hewn out by the ax. I was found there unconscious. I knew not when, but supposedly the same day, I aroused just long enough to observe a man in white uniform trying to get me into, what which learned later, an ambulance. I had a gown on which was furnished by the hospital and to me I was most sure it was one of my sisters dresses. I remember protesting and refusing to wear it. Then I fell back into the coma. I knew nothing until much later. After my treatment and when my fever finally broke, I began to notice and recognize that my sister and I were in the same room. I was attended by Dr. Marvel, who had about the time I had begun to recover from my fever; which had been so high that I was at one time reported to be dead; stood at the foot of my bed and in joking with me, quacked like a duck. He said quacking was the only sound that he had been able to get out of me. He would always greet me with the question, “How’s my little duck this morning?”

Previous to my sickness, I had made my first attempt to paint. Having been impressed by the story and news photo in the Item News paper of Indianapolis about the sinking of the Titanic, in which hundreds of people had drowned after the ship had struck an iceberg. Before the rescue ship could reach them, it had sunk. The little picture I had painted in water color was a reproduction of this ship sinking like the news photo had shown. I remember that my mother brought this picture to the hospital and showed it to all of the staff. They had passed it around and praised me so in thinking it was very good. This was the first inkling of my art ability. I recall the day we left the hospital. They were mowing the lawns and the trees were in full leaf and the sweet smell of spring was in the air. When they picked me up they lifted me under the arms and I screamed out with pain, “Oh! My boils.” I had gotten boils and infection under both of my arms; which followed on for a number of years.	At one time I had counted twenty-nine on my back and shoulders.	(Howard became ill during the time of the sinking of the Titanic, April 14, 1912 and he would have been 10 years old).

Now going on six years of age, they put me in a school, District No. 6. It was located very close to the Richmond Pumping station, which was the only source of water at that time. It was an old building with one room and an old pot-bellied stove and an American Flag in the corner. I remember a very large book of maps which sat on a pedestal, and the ornamental cast iron seats, and desks which ranged from primer-class size to the fourth grade size. Over the door of this little school, someone had hung a horseshoe for a good luck symbol. It had been suspended with two strands of bailing wire. I remember two boys, Harry and Walter Goodwin, who lived almost directly across from the school. The older boy, Harry, had many times previous, when recess was announced, when coming out with the rest of the children, would give out a yell and run and jump up and would catch the horse shoe and swing out then drop out on the concrete side walk. I was present on one occasion when the school teacher, Mrs. Fisher, cautioned him saying, “Harry, one day that wire is going to break.” It was only some days later that it happened. I was just close enough that when his head hit the concrete step, I saw him laying shivering in unconsciousness and blood was running out of his mouth. The younger brother, Walter, who was about my age, went running across the road and called out “Harry’s killed himself.” His mother, a very large woman came running across the road with dough up to her elbows and her arms wrapped in her apron. I saw no more of the episode, for school was then taken up. At a much later date, long after I was married, I met Walter and recalling the day he told me that Harry was never right from that accident and he had now passed on.

After two weeks or so the entire group was moved to a new school which had been in the process of being built with two rooms and four grades in each up to the eighth grade which I eventually completed. I remember one of my first fights. A Kenneth Sells, who would have a marble game with the rest of us boys, which we always held just in back of the school on the cinders from the furnace that had been leveled out. One day, for no particular reason, Kenneth kicked the marbles out of the ring. I chased him and tied into him with the result of a wrestling match. I came out of it with one black eye. The teacher caught Ken and questioned him and he was then expelled from school.

In the spring of my seventh grade year, being about 1914; Mr. White, my teacher, came into the room looking very stern and said, “the crisis has come; we are in war.” (We, in the U.S., had not yet gone into ward but it was in Europe and we were preparing ourselves in case we would enter.) I had, at this time, been helping to assemble and old two winged Jenny air craft that had been salvaged from the war. I had noticed a truck loaded with the separated parts and I watched it being unloaded just across the river in a stubble field. This was in the days of the Barn Stormer and the pilots from the war who had been said to have “flown by the seat of their pants.” I watched the planes take off and land, coming dangerously close to the telephone lines and wondering how long it would be before there would be a mis-hap. I can remember a man who flew over Richmond after night on several occasions with some lights and fireworks which which many of the towns
people watched with amusement.

Now being out of school, I needed to get a job. The East Yard of the Pennsylvania Railroad had been started in a project with track running parallel to the main line laying between our location and Glen Miller Park.	he main line which runs closer to the park tunnels were being build over the stream that drained from the Miller saw mill pond to the ice pond to carry the track from the hump where dispatched trains were made up in process of their destination.

I applied for a job to a man by the name of Tom Prue, who headed the construction. He wanted to know what I had in mind to do. I replied, “ Perhaps water carrier.” But I hired in for $1.50 a day. Tom Prue was a heavy man about two hundred pounds and slightly above average height with a jovial disposition.	He was graying at the temples and dressed as though he would take on a roll of a circus manager. He wore a white vest, white spats and had a big gold railroad watch and chain hanging from his lower vest pocket. I supposed this is why he asked me if I wanted to water the elephants. I had worked in circuses many times and had been water carrier t the elephants and helped the roustabout.	We worked with several crews hauling cinders, grading, filling and building in track and concrete runs and foundation for repaired track an the round house. I worked two years in all. The second year, at the age of sixteen, we had been called to work the main line replacing small rail with hundred pound rail and sodding banks. There had been two groups, one under Tom Mulvahill and the other, under Frank Shippley. We had just previously been working on the hump and as water boy I had been called to help Shippley measure off ties to be sawed and spliced to make up rope length for the graduating width of the switch track which diverted each car to the proper track to make up the train.

While we were still working main line, two crews had been put together of sixty men. The men were strung along the north side of the track for close to a quarter of a mile, sodding and grading bank. I had watered from the springs, east to about half of the men before my water in the two buckets had been depleted. After returning from the spring, I deliberately bypassed those who had been watered in my last trip around. Yet many called out to me, supposedly for water. I looked down, failing to keep in mind the instructions given me on how I should walk main line. I was to always make sure that I would be facing the locomotive, east or west. I was in meditation, mostly to water those who had not been watered. I was not alerted that their calls to me were warnings, until my boss, Mr. Shippley, who had never been know to take a drink of water until all the other men had been served, now called to me and I just barely had time to look his direction as he pointed to the on coming train. The wind was against it and I could not hear the whistle if there was one.	I can only remember the round front end of the locomotive which came at me and enlarged so fast before my eyes. With the two heavy buckets of water, I had no time to think and I don’t recall thinking or making any decision, and I don’t know how I got out of the track. The only ting I do remember, is that I was lying close enough to the rail that the water from my buckets, as they were both demolished by the train wheels, and the heat of the steam from the cylinder of the train burned my skin. Old Lou, an old gandy dancer who had taken interest in me, picked me up saying, “Waterery boy, I thought that was the last of you!” How did you know to jump?” The answer never came for I was speechless and in a state of shock. In the split second timing, that was left, I suppose some Devine assistance had come to my rescue. For I do believe I was actually lifted from that track.

While on the railroad, I had been running with one boy by the name of Lance Newman, who had been carrying water for his dad’s group Bill Newman. He had been putting away tools in the evening and making like shoveling and tamping ties and was receiving a man’s pay of $4.50 per day. As Tom Prue came down the track, I approached him with the proposition declaring I was	able to do the same as Lance. He asked, “Can you lick him?” I said “sure.” At this, he set up a schedule to meet at the spring in the park where we both were carrying water. That afternoon, I managed to get there the same time as Lance. There he sat in the shade, we both filled our buckets and as Lance passed me, I grabbed him and in the wrestle we went.	In a short time I had him down with a double hammer lock. As I looked up, Tom said, “Alright, tomorrow morning, you start drawing the rate asked for.”

It was now at the age of sixteen, that the recklessness of the men who tossed a rail which bounced and landed on the foot of Mr. Shippley and broke two of his toes.	In realizing the would be layed up, he said, “this will lay me up and I have no man capable to carry on in my place unless it would be the water boy.” At this, I took over continuing to make up the splicing and getting the proper length and completed the hump track in his absence.

By now I was becoming a man, I had learned to earn my own way, fight the odds and seek opportunity for myself. I had for sometime, longed to go into the west which was spurred by adventure, and the lure to hunt big game. After spending a greater portion of my earnings to send my sister through college and a new washing machine for my mother, I had bought myself a good 22 rifle and a bicycle. My step-father resented these acts for he had never been able to provide more than a scant living. My mother had tried to hold a rule of good etiquette at the table. She had failed with either of my step-father and my two half brothers, Robert and Russell. This was the reason for the episode which built up to the cause for me to leave home.

One of my half brothers followed the example set by his father and reached across the table with the butcher knife and stabbed a loaf of bread and dragged it to him, rather than asking for it to be passed. I called him for it and my step-father went into a rage. After a two week period of not even as much as to speak with me, he threatened to take possession of all my money and I declared to him that he could take no part of it and I would show him so even through a court of law if necessary. He challenged me saying, “If you have another word, I’ll take you up from the table.	I suggested, “Maybe you’d have to try that.”	Even though he was over six feet and much heavier than me, I had become toughened with my work on the railroad and I knew my strength. We were seated at a one leg-centered table. I reached under the table and caught hold of the center leg as he took hold of the back of my chair. He porceeded to lift me, which resulted in upsetting the table and spilling the contents of the evening meal.	t that point, I stood up and grabbed him by the shoulders and backed him in the coner of the room. Mother said not to hit him and I answered, “there is no need to hit him, for he has already beat himself.” He had broken out in a cold sweat and we seated him in a chair. I went about strapping my gun to the bicycle and proceeded on my way west. I was then past the age of seventeen.

It was a long hot ride twenty-three miles west through the city of Cambridge, to Dublin where I knew two uncles lived. No one was at home at my Uncle Franks, so I crossed the road to my Uncle Ed’s. When I told him I was headed west, he said, “Your journey will have to be delayed; I have just been looking for someone to help me pour a cement floor in the metal garage I built.”

Of course I was hungry and at the dinner table he made a poposition that he would help me take a course of sheet metal drafting at the Scranton, Pennsylvania Correspondence and offered to make a drawing table.	I had advised him that I had already had drafting experience and tools for I had just completed a course of mechanical drafting with that same company. So I stayed on for I never turned down an opportunity to better my skills. The next day, I went to work in his shop then known as “Huddleston Brothers Sheet Metal” where three uncles; Orie, Ed, and Frank had consolidated. Before winter that same year, I got pneumonia.	I was terribly sick with a high fever and I came very close to death. He seemed to have very little concern for me and in every action and remark convinced me that he had lost interest. I continued the course and finished as soon as I got well to work.

I had now moved to the youngest of the brothers, Uncle Orie’s. In the home of my grandfather, Samuel Brown Huddleston. Grandmother Huddleston still lived, but grandfather had already passed on. The stay was not long there. After I had become curious about a letter that had come, I recognized the handwriting and was most certain that it came from my father, who I had been told died in Jonesboro, Arkansas. I never had any confirmation of this nor did I believe it. Upon asking to see the letter, my Uncle Orie ordered me to stop my talk and threatened to get an officer and arrest me. He suggested that I go to my Uncle Frank’s in Dublin.

My uncle Frank had me fix an upper room in their house at my own cost and I did so. It was to be my room and I was to pay my way by helping to build and rehabilitate an old building. While staying there, I became acquainted with a boy from England; Reginald Dale. He was quite a talented artist. We became quite good friends, we hunted and fished and buddied together. My art inclination had been sharpened and the two of us began to work at it. This was the start of what I now have become.

There came a day that a tent meeting moved in where many carnivals had set up in the middle of Cambridge. The church known as the Holy Rollers revival. I had met Reginald in the town that evening and had mentioned that I would like to go to this meeting. I had tried to become a member of the Methodist Church in Cambridge and I had joined. My Sunday School teacher, Mr. Robert Fancher, who was the only source of this type of teaching that I had experienced. Reginald agreed to go with me to the tent meeting. I seated myself fairly close to the temporary stage upon which stood an improvised pulpit. The evangelist directed the singing, having us use a few books and verses passed among us. As we sat and listened to the singing and when the preaching service started and was very short, which had been known to be typical of their method for they were to work up the emotions of the people and have them come forward and recognize them as a church. I knew the first man that got to his feet just after the evangelist called out, “Look up when you pray, God can’t hear you murmering in the sawdust.” At this, the man, Tom Eliot, who was big and tall and worked in the foundary where I was now working and who was known for the many times at revivals where he had promised to follow and never did. His confession was, “I have sworn and beat my wife and have drank and sinned and I’m going to quit it all. About that time a heavy middle aged woman got out of her chair and lifted up her arms and called out”Lord, send us down soldiers to help us fight our many battles.” This disturbed me to where I was undecided. I had an urge to go, but I was not sure if there was anything for me. Until Robert Fancerh, my sunday school teacher, came up behind me and put his hand on my shoulder and said, “Now, Howard, if you feel like you want to go up, I’ll go up and sit with you.” It’s only a short time and I will have to meet my train.” His job took him to the depot on the high grade. I went and I felt nothing, and I said nothing.
 
I merely stood up and brushed the sawdust off my knees and hurried out the side entrance. I had forgotten about Reginald, when he came upon me as I headed for town. It was then, that he told me that he had been, since in England, converted through a sister Speed, into the “Mormon” faith. This upset me greatly, for I had only memory of the so called “Mormons”*who had nothing spoken in favor of them. The only impression I had of them was of a people who had done most things wrong and therefore had not existed any longer. Now, to find my best friend and artist companion, declaring he was one of them. Yet stayed on together and I got acquainted with his family; mother, sister and two brothers, who through the aid of their Uncle Lolly Dale, who had been established in the oldest country store in Cambridge for years. He had gone bond for that family and made it possible for them to come to this country after their father had been killed in World War 1.

 
 
ORPHA MOORE 1
 
Time had passed now, and both Uncle Ed and Uncle Frank had died. The business had fallen to Uncle Orie. He ventured to exploit the business far in excess of that which was possible for him to earn. I suspicioned that he had used the money that my father was sending to support my sister and me. Of course he denied it but from his actions I was quite sure I was right. He had taken up drinking to an excess and was losing his business very fast in the new location. I left him and took a job in the Rouch Cigar Factory in Cambridge which was a branch to the one Indianapolis. After learning to roll a cigar in a short time, I became the top roller. Turning out 1200 cigars in an eight hour period.
Netting $35.00 per week, piece work. The process was to have a bunch breaker seated at a table making and rolling moistened tobacco which was known as the bunch.	This
 
was placed in a wooden mold to dry after which I would roll on a wrapper. My bunch breaker was Mrs. Orpha Moore, wife of Samuel Moore, who became later my in-laws. After I had turned down a girl from the factory,
Mrs. Moore had asked me if I would like to write to a boy that had worked there when I had first started and
who was now in the Navy. She invited me to come to her house on a Sunday, that I might obtain his address. I went and found the place on Chruch Street in Cambridge. We talked shop for quite some time. Intermittently, several times she would motion out toward the dining room. I didn’t know whether
it was a pet or what. Finally, in came a bashful golden haired daughter, dressed in
blue silk; that she had never mentioned. I had no idea then that her intention was what it proved out to be.	Before I had finished discussing the reason for turning down this previous girl and also complaining about my stay where I was renting, she made arrangements for me to take a small bedroom and live with them. It appealed to me and in a short time, Mrs. Moore proved to be more of a mother than what I had ever known. e attended movies, walked the moon lit streets and I became quite fond of Marie, the daughter. The Moore’s had accepted me like one of their own. Mrs. Moore became disabled to work for she found that she had cancer. I escorted her to Richmond to the doctor for treatments.

 
Shortly after, a local theater proprietor, knowing of my artistic ability, asked if I could take an old drop curtain from the Hurst Opera House, in Cambridge, which
 

MARIE MOORE
 
had long been forsaken except for an occasional medicine show. I was in the act of repainting on this small
stage when a man who came from Omaha, Nebraska to install a drapery setting and an advertising curtain for the same theater. In noticing my work, Mr. Hatfield, the man spoken of, said, “Kid, where did you learn to handle fresco like that?” I replied, “What’s fresco?” “To me its only water color.” He then advised me that termpera, meaning water base, was fresco and had existed long before oil. He suggested I make a small example of my work and ability and that he might take it back to the old man, meaning, N.C. Chivalier of the Star Scenic Studio, 19th and Fanam, Omaha, Nebraska. Mrs. Moore was quite upset to see me go.
*See Joseph Smith History
She made the remark which literally came true and I shall never forget, saying, “You’ll never darken my door again.” The treatment that they were using in that day scattered the cancer througout her body and in less
than one year, I received a letter from Marie telling me that her mother was so bad in convulsions and had to
be quieted with a strong medication. I knew she would not have long to live.
 
I had been making good with the studio, for I had started from the bottom at $12.00 a week just to clean brushes and sweep floors and in less than a yar, I had worked up to top artist making $45.00 a week. I had taken a room at the YMCA and I chose a restaurant just a short distance from the studio. They had issued me a card which they would punch each time I would have a meal. I soon got wise to an idea that if I were to bring a lunch, I wouldn’t go at noon but could start painting on the set where the other men had left it. They would take the elevator and would go to lunch leaving me free to study the method. I followed so close for five weeks and no one had detected what I was up to. But one day, I had failed to hear the elvevator door open they all walked in on me. Mr. Chivalier said, “You’d better come into the office.” I think he said this mainly to satisfy the other artists. But I too, thought that I would be dismissed. He merely asked me how long I had been doing it? I told him for five weeks. He then replied, “If not one of us was able to distinguish the difference in the work, you would have had to continue painting drapery and I will have to raise your wages.” Bill Donahue, who was the main artist painting the secenery on the add curtain, was not too happy, believing that I should have been fired.

A short time after that, we had received the job for a very large theater in Lincoln, Nebraska.	The perscenium Arch opening measured forty by sixty feet. Our frames were only big enough to do one half the add curtain which closed that opening. Upon this the scene was to be painted which was always left up to the artist to paint what he saw fit. We proceeded to make the entire set, cutting each section from the large canvas such as borders to mask off the ceiling all in simulated hanging drapes. Next, the side tabs and the legs, which protruded from the side tabs varying in length. The farthest back making possible for entrance onto the stage. The add curtain would have a Lambrican design with flowing drapes simulated with gold tassels hanging from a cord. The edging was simulated with pom-poms hanging around the entire lower edge with pleats toward the bottom and many different shaped and sized advertising space upon which the copy would be submitted and had to be written in by a sign painter. At that time, I had the desire to learn sign painting which was postponed for the time. The installer of the curtain, Mr. Chivalier and Bill Donahue left Wally, another helper, and me at the studio. We were instructed to prepare a canvas to do a scene to show what ability we have for Mr. Chivalier to observe on his return. I had not been in the Rocky Mountains before, but the man who ran the elevator suggested that I paint a scene of the Rockies. By his dictations I did so, although, I doubted my ability to make a success for all of my work had been done of eastern scenery. Upon the return of Mr. Chivalier, he asked for our paintings. My picture was depicting mountains, stream and trees. To this day, I don’t believe it was entirely western. Never the less, it was good enough that from then on, I was privileged to do the add curtain scene and this made me evened up as the top artist.

WEDDING PHOTO- HOWARD MADE DRESS

 
I went home in time to attend Mrs. Moore’s funeral. I had left quite a few valuables in Omaha that I never did retrieve. I had gained a home with the Moore’s and had learned the needs of Marie, and found the inability of her father to understand her needs. She and I made a trip to Covington, Kentucky and we were married on 17 April, 1923. We started housekeeping in the upstairs room of my mother’s place in Richmond, which was very poorly furnished. I was needing a job and the east yards in Richmond had been totally completed with the big round house and there had become a strike of the workers in the round house and there on the repair yards. My close neighbor was working there and when they struck, he had taken a job at Vulcan Springs but I had found an advertisement on the railroad and answered it to a Mr. Gus Paflin. He asked me what my trade was and I told him a pipe fitter. He hired me so quick saying I’d start to work in the next morning on an hourly rate of seventy-five cents. As I had never drawn more than forty cents hourly, anywhere, I feared that I was not qualified for that high of rate and said,”all the experience I’ve had is with an uncle, fitting water wells.” His answer, “Well, pipe
is pipe.” “You be on the job in the morning.” We were now able to better furnish our room and I bought my first car, a 1924, Ford Touring car.
 

In January of 1924, we went to Indianapolis and stayed with my Uncle LeRoy Huddleston. While I was there I painted my first portrait of a four year old boy. For payment, I received a practically new suit of clothes. At a later date, my uncle had decided I should take a painting that I had done in water color down to Lieber’s Art Store, there in Indianapolis. When we got there we had to wait some time before the man could come to talk with us for he had been busy selling a painting. A very small well dressed little woman had been going back and forth across the gallery trying to make up her mind on which one of the two paintings she wanted to buy. Finally, She chose one done by A.R. Franklin. She reminded the proprietor that as she had told him previously that she would have to pay for it in two payments. The first one was $108.00. At that time, I failed to see any particular value in the work of art she chose. Then the salesman came to us asking, “what can I do for you?” I unwrapped the painting which I had taken and right away he seated himself on a bench and in trying to impress, with his hands upon his chin, his elbows on his knees and a scowl upon his brow. I thought he was never going to make up his mind or have anything to say at all. Finally, he asked the question, “Who was your tutor?” Meaning who had I taken art lessons from. My uncle advised him that I had not been taught by anybody but had done it on my own. At this he declared several things wrong with the painting and finally ended up with saying, “My best advice to you is to get under some good tutor who had renown, then your work will be worth something.” At this, I was not pleased. Without taking time to rewrap the picture, I said to my uncle, “Let’s get out of here.”

In February of that same year, I had decided to go into Dubuque, Iowa with a man from my uncle’s neighborhood. I remember it was very cold with snow on the ground. The morning after arriving there, we searched the paper for employment advertisement sections. We were attracted to an ad for a salesman to sell Hamilton Beach Vaccum cleaners. This we tried for three weeks but found it to be unprofitable. I then had met a young man from the office of the Apple Higgly Co. Which was a small business just started in making electrical stand lamps and they were in need of someone with an artistical ability. I seemed to fit the job pretty well. I applied my artistry to quite a number of shades. Not forseeing the future, I sent for Marie and had her take a train and meet me in Chicago. From there we both took another train on to Dubuque. We lived there through the winter but Marie was pregnant with our first child and was terribly sick all the while we were there. Besides that the people were so prejudiced that we couldn’t get to know them very well.	We went back to Cambridge City.

Soon after getting home and re-established, I took a job at the Mal Gray Foundary. My job there was to haul in sand, brick, and cut sand on all the floors. Then I was to mold an annealing pot and then at pour off time, as fast as the molds were poured and cooled enough, I had to dump one or two floors. Then I was to follow through hooking out the casting and piling them. This I was to do to complete my day. I was not too happy with this job, knowing I had sufficient talent to earn a better wage. One day my boss Mr. Thompson, stopped me as I was hauling a wheel barrow of sand. He complained about me not having it loaded to the brim. As I had figured to load lightly so that I might be able to get through the sand with the iron tired wheel. But as he made the remark, “What are you doing running through with that little jag?” I porceeded to dump the entire measure on his feet saying, “There’s your wheel-barrow, sand, and your job. I quit!”

After moving from Richmond to Cambridge City, to live with Marie’s father on Church Street, our first child was born, September 4, 1924. We names her Sharlott Coleen. I had built the cradle for her and it was made with open-wire bottom and springs with a cotton mat with a crochetted edging and a tasseled fringe done by my own hands. Sharlott died soon after birth, for Marie was in labor for three days before. The reason for the child’s death was unknown. Marie also miscarried in the summer of 1925.

I now took my little runabout Ford and built onto it back bows like a covered wagon, and covered it with cnvas and made just enough room to sleep in it. Marie and I headed out for the north area of Indiana, painting signs and stage scenery which was a hold over from the knowledge and experience while in Omaha, Nebraska at the Star Scenic Studio. Coming though Winchester, we had parked in the center of town for supper. Coming from the restaurant, we found that we had gained a self-appointed guardian, meaning a German Police puppy. He laid underneath the truck and even though he came to us very friendly, he would bark and snarl at anyone else passing by. We accepted him and took him along. We called him Chester. Coming home in late summer, Chester had grown to be quite big and had become quite a menace to the neighborhood; especially to one old negro man who was a retired chef of the Pennsylvania Railroad. I gave Chester to a farmer.

We held a home cottage meeting at Reginalds home many times. Sometimes we were accompanied by the two missionaries of the Mormon Church which was being sent out periodically to gain converts. It had now become time for us to be scheduled by Reginald and one missionary named, Dyke, for baptism of Marie and myself. The scheduling was a surprise to both of us. Yet we complied and the next day, May 4, 1927, we were taken out along a branch of the White River which ran through Cambridge and were baptized. The water was very cold and Marie hesitated, but followed and we were recorded as members of the Mormon Church.

Deloris was born June 20, 1926 and Beulah Althea was born Sept. 28, 1927. Deloris died November 17, 1927 by getting hold of strictnine tablets that had been thrown away. Wanda May was born August 21, 1928.	We moved to Ft. Wayne, Indiana and took a job at the Auto Renewal Company. One child was born there, Joan, December 28, 1929. I had started to buy a small home and made one payment only. I received a telegram asking me to come back to the Davis Aircraft Company, where I had previously worked, to restore and rebuild the burned planes that had been burned in a fire. They had lost twelve to fifteen planes. Not being too well satisfied with the house; I complied. We moved back to Richmond, where I applied my sheet metal knowledge as well as my painting ability to doing the wings in striping and monograming and lettering. I had become a sign paintor as well. By now, My father-in-law had sold his house and had gone to the Odd Fellows Home in Greensburg, Indiana, where he died on 4 March, 1930.	While I was working at the Davis Aircraft, Norman was born, March 11, 1913.

Now looking back to what my life has been, I take much pride in recognizing that I had been destined to be born in the location of Richmond, in the state of Indiana, at the time when industry of this great nation was in it’s infancy and also noting that my background stems from people who were ingenious and mechanically inclined. They were some of the very first wheelwrights of that area, carriage makers, the first auto painters, sheet metal workers, and builders, of all sorts. These with my outward look constantly being alerted to a chance to further my learning capacity bringing me into an understanding of why I have been priviledged to work in many different fields. I have become skilled in all lines of maintenance which now proves to be very benficial in the upkeep of my present belongings. The city of Richmond was one of the geographic locations where many things were, and still are, manufactued and sent all over the world.	Things such as, The Garr Scott Factory, which made the old steam threshing machines, the Reliance Foundery that made moulders of railroad parts, International Harvester, Wayne Skate factory, Starr Piano Factory, later the F.& N. Lawnmower factory, the Richmond Baking Co., B.B. Glove Factory, Perfect Circle, Piston Ring Factory, Avco Factory, Davis Motor Co.-then known as the Davis Aircraft – then later the Davis Lawnmower Co., the Atlas Underware Co., Vulcan Springs, Motor Boy Lawnmower, Crosley Manuafacturing Corporation, and the Metal, Hoffman Sheet Metal, Johns Manville Corporation, and the Hastings Candy Factory. These manufacturers have always been part of the industry since the beginning of the mechanical age.

Having bought the rights of the unfinished monoplane, which had only been partly developed by two boys of Troy, Ohio, Mr. G.W. Davis of Davis Motor Company of Richmond had hired several people according to their skills, welding and general assembly including me.	We started work to develop this one winged monoplane described as a high lift wing with a centered section fuel tank and a thrity-foot wing span and sixteen-foot fusilage. With my ingenuity they had practically depended on me to form devices, gigs, and method of creating many rib sections for the fins which were tempered steel sheets cut into tapering strips and formed by hand over a die. The door, head rest, gas tank, and all the cowlings, I designed every part other than the tubing. All these pieces numbered 170 seperate sheet metal parts which I had designed and brought into production. I would then mask off the plane, which had been covered with a fabric of light weight and closed texture weave and diped with a fast drying prixlin material which would tighten up like a drum. It then would be coated twice with lacquer, for straping and following up with the monogram which I also designed carrying the name of Davis Aircraft. I also did the wing lettering black on silver in thirty inch letters visible at a high altitude from the ground. After I left the plant, I made scale model including all the working parts which was photographed by the Paladium Item news Paper in Richmond. I also made five smaller crafts made to scale taken from well known planes which were World War fighters.	This particular small plane was first motored with a sixty horse power Lambert, four cylinder radial motor. Pat Love, who was the test pilot, after several months flying and trying to develop this craft into a two seated training ship with a duel stick and controls. The day came when Pat came into the shop and called to me, “Huddleston, clean off your bench!” At this he picked up the sixteen-foot fusilage frame structure which was welded of various sized steel tubing with londrons and cross members, and such. He put this up on my bench which I had swept off onto the floor. He grabbed the hack saw and severed the whole thing. Then he went to the rack and picked out tubing that would just fit inside of the four longdrons then he called out the welders which were three and saying, “If you men think you can weld, weld that together, I’ve got to fly it!” At this the men looked at one another, and with amazement and some remark was made,”He’s fixin to kill himself!”	Anyway we all went to work. I had made some adjustments in sheet metal parts in a week or ten days, we had the construction nearly completed and in doing, finding that the additional length had increased the aft weight seventy-five pounds more. His first flight caused the plane to fly with the tail section dragging very low. He circled the field once or twice and while we watched, he dove out of the sky almost straight down from about 7,000 feet, leveling off just in time and landed. Without a word spoken to anyone, he just lit a cigarette and jumped into his car and drove away.

The next morning he told several of us how he had ordered a ninty horse power Kenner Motor from Cincinnati which came in a few days. We went to work and installed this motor and I had to revamp the motor cowlings again. This proved to be just what this plane needed, more power and whip stream to carry the elevator and give more control. Even though the ship now was working out to a fine point in excess of what was required for a training ship, yet, the men who had the say so held back on licensing the plane. Apparently, they had a disliking for Pat Love. I guess I was the only man in the factory who really did understand this problem. Pat had flown in many combat flights with many ace pilots and had survived many dog fights. He held one scar where a bullet had come through the floor board and layed his face open from his
chin to the temple. This had only sharpened his Irish temper to the extent to where no one seemed to
understand him. Many times, he had shown it evident that he had no use for anyone who was likely to show fear. They had been hiring young men in the summer months from Earlham College and they would come up to Pat to ask anything necessary pertaining to their work. They would show evidence of fear in the way they would apporach him and many times I had heard his loud voice calling, “W-H-A-T?” I always knew that some feeble question had been asked of him for this was always the way he answered. Yet this never became a circumstance between him and me, for I was somewhat like unto him. Therefore, we understood each other and got along.

The inspectors, in order to hold back the license, had required that a sand bag test would be tried. I, myself, had assisted in tying five to ten pound sand bags on the aerolon, elevator, and rudder.	The evening when he had taken this ship up with this extra weight which was to similate an ice-clad condition which had proved fatal to many planes many times.	Still, he was willing to put this to a test. We watched him gaining a height of some 10,000-12,000 ft.	He flew the plane around the field and we could see evidence of how sluggish the controls were. Then he began to dive and pulling up suddenly and whipping off the sand bags. We could see them fall. He made several attempts at this. Yet apparently, the elevators were still holding the extra weight and this made it more difficult to keep balance. He had now maneuvored over the area of the river and gained haeavier atmosphere and it looked like he had crashed for he disappeared behind the horizon.	People began to get into their cars including the inspectors. We all believed that he had crashed. Yet, before anyone had left the lot, we could hear the motor and up out of that river bottom he came and he didn’t stop until he got to a great height and dove and did a barrel role and and inside loop then an outside loop showing evidence that he had thrown off all of the sand bags and proving the ship quite worthy. Again, he took a long dive toward the field much steeper than I had ever seen anyone approach the field. He set it down and again, without a word, he lit a cigarette anad jumped into his car and drove away. Still the inspectors refued to license the plane. I had noticed there was somewhat of a stalemate between Pat and Davis. Yet Davis was not testing this plane and making the necessary changes at the risk that Pat had made and I learned from rumors that before the First World War was over, Love, had been grounded for sometime because he had been over conficent in his flying. He had flown several times and underneath a bridge. Even though each time was successful, the Airforce saw no need of such a risk of man and equipment, therefore, they grounded him. About this time, Davis, knowing that this plane was not going to be licensed as long as Pat was flying it, rigged another plane with forty-five gallons of auxillary fuel for a cross country flight from Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio to Denver, Colorado. During this time, Davis flew to Wright Field and got the plane licensed and was back the same evening. When Pat came in, only to find that this had been done, he automatically quit. Pat left Richmond to take a job with the American Eagle Rock Company in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He had tested a plane that had been know tokill three test pilots for it had a tendency to go into a flat spin which no one had been able to live through. He tested this plane on a Friday and on Monday of the next week, the plane that he took up evidently had not been corrected for it went into that flat spin and even though this company had required that he have a parachute, he didn’t use it, for he had always declared that as long as the plane had two wings he would never take to the chute. The word came that he had crashed and the entire motor had buried itself into the dirt. The doctors report was that there had not been one bone in his whole body that was not broken or mangled. Still he lived and hour and forty minutes before he died.

In 1931, upon the hill above my mther’s place was the Border wrecking company where I painted a sign straight across for a 1925 For model Roadster. One tire looked very bad and I picked up a set of connecting rods and threw them into the back trunk. My brother-in-law, Oliver Morton, had a tire shop and did vulcanizing. He looked at the tires and said “You might get to Indianapolis,” which was seventy three miles west. Still, without work, and plenty of time and little or no money, I took my two half brothers, Robert and Russell Summerfruit, and we headed west. We made it to Montrose, Colorado. My two brothers took off afoot aiming to go to California and try to locate an uncle. Before Robert and Ressell left me, on our way and coming through Kansas, the car showed evidence that the connecting rods were going out. Knowing that I had picked up four very rusty connecting rods and pistons, Robert asked, “What do you want to do?” I told him to just drive as far as he could. Along about two o’clock in the morning, he woke me, for Russell and I had been trying to sleep for some time. He said, “this is it!” So we stopped and all three of us found a place in the bar pit on the right side of the road and soon fell asleep. The next morning, come day light, I decided we had better make some repairs. As we approached the car we suddenly realized that we had made our beds in a rattle snake den. There were several holes in the bank where we laid and three large rattle snakes snaked on the highway. We then went to the car and took the pan off the car and droped the pistons and cylinders out. I gave Robert a hammer and told him to knock out the wrist pins. I hadn’t instructed him to save the pistons for we only wanted to change rods and the bearings. Before I knew it, he had broken one of the good pistons, V-shaped section reaching past the second ring groove. I called out, “Be careful, we have to use that piston.” He was under the impression that we were going to try to use the old rusty pistons that I had brought along. But they would not even turn on the wrist pin. I said, “Never mind, just bring that pan of oil and take care that you
don’t spill any of it. For that little bit of oil has to run us until we get to a station.” We walked about a hundred fifty feet to where I had seen one lone concrete post in the fence that ran along just above the bank where we had slept. With the motor oil applied to the corner of the post, I ground very carefully, the edges of the broken piston. We assembled the parts including this broken one. And now with the new bearings and very little oil we made our trip as far as Montrose. I hesitated to cross the mountain range for my doctor had told me I had a leakage of the heart and couldn’t take the altitude. After a week stay, I headed back. On my way out, a young man who was thumbing his way east, approaced me and said his home was in Kokomo, Indian. We then decided to cheapen the trip by taking off the entire body of the car and build a platform on the chasis and boxes for the seats. He claimed to be a race car driver. I was soon convinced of his ability, for on Sunday the highways were quite crowded, but he seemed to get through and around traffic better than anyone I had ever seen. The old ignition coil system was failing with age and while he drove, I had to continuously tap the boxes to keep the spark flowing. The old tire, told of before, had not gone far until we had a slight blow out through the one hole which had shown up in the tire before we had started.	We made repair with another innertube and had found a boot which was no more than a patch of rubber that had finally worn through causing the blow out. I must say that before we got home we had moved this boot four different times. After two day of travel, we came into Richmond. Within one mile from home we ran out of gas and out of money. I called the man who I had obtained the car and asked him if he had remembered my venture to take a chance on a trip and told him I was back in town stranded. I asked him if he would come and take me home. He complied and in a short time he came and towed me home. Anyway, I had seen the west and I had disproved my doctor’s theory about not being able to take the altitude for I had climbed to the height of Monarch Pass and 12,000 ft on Look Out Mountain. I had never felt better. I knew then that the west was the place for me and I then resolved to eventually return at the first opportunity.

Still using the same old Ford, I was now working in Davis Aircraft again and driving back and forth to work in it. One evening, on the way home, I got within a mile of home and ran out of gas. There were no stations close and I went into a Quiggly drug store on nineteenth and E. Stree, Richmond. I asked the proprietor what he had that an old Ford could run on in place of gas. He said, “All I have is raw benzine.” So I bought a gallon. It didn’t only work to my surprise; but that old Ford did more tricks than it had ever been invented to do. I even feared that the ignition system would burn up but nothing seemed to harm it.

I traded the old Ford for a 1921 Dodge and built it into a housecar with sleeping facilities. Reginald Dale had said, “If you ever go west, stop and take me with you.” I did so and found that he had moved to Terre Haute, Indiana, and was living with his brother. After going that far I was delayed for a week waiting for him to make up his mind about going. He was under the impression that he was about to be married to a girl who was not a member of the Mormon Church. We came on west and each morning, Reginald would not feel right to start without a word of prayer and asking for safety on the way. But one morning we neglected to take time and before noon of that day, on a strip of road that was being built, we ran off onto soft shoulder which had just been built and the car and all merely hung in the balance. The olnly help in sight was a truck driver who was just unloading a pile of rock from the crushers. He said he would be glad to help, but he was on a time schedule and was due back at the crusher for another load. Yet he did oblige us and came and dragged us back onto the road. We continued to a northern route where we had learned that Robert, my half brother, had taken work for a rancher at Big Sandy, Wyoming. We hunted out the trail from Rock Springs, north and enquiring our way we finally located him. We spent a week or so at the ranch house of Mr. Richie, where Bob worked. Now, coming on down toward Utah, we had by evening decided to stop at a spring house where milk had been gathered from the farmers to be picked up by the truck each morning.	Our youngest child, Norman, who was only one year and a little over. I noticed the lights in a barn just across the way and took a pail to see if I could buy milk for- I knew it was milking time. The farmer filled my pail, and would not accept my money. Upon returning to the car, I saw a woman approaching us from the house just down the road. She explained she had just been reading or had some source been advised that there would be people who were converts to the Church that would be seeking to make their home in Utah. She asked if we were members of the the Mormon Faith. In finding out that we were, she returned to her house and came with a basket of provisions for us. After which we continued on. By mid-afternoon the next day the bearings on the right rear wheel was entirely gone. We had noticed our destination making it Salt Lake City. When we arrived, I went into the Mormon Museum and asked for one of the twelve apostles. (editors note: He was not likely to find an apostle at the museum, but must have been directed to the Church office building) I asked advice about where the most likley place for a family such as ours could get started. His remark was “Well, the Lord knows it’s cold enough here, and with your trade line, you would stand a better chance to find work north, but I feel to advise that you head south to about Mason Dixon Line where they can still gather wood off the hills and winters are not so cold.” We took his advice but, Reginald wanted to hunt out the place where he had stayed and worked for a rug and carpet company on his first trip out. The business was closed due to the depression. So we were convinced there was nothing there for either of us. I promised Reginald that if he still felt to stay in Salt Lake, I would let him out at any corner as we drove south. After stopping three or four times and each time he would finally say drive on, until we were out of the suburbs. When he said, “I feel better now, I’ll go on with you.” We had not been able to do anything about the bad wheel, we just drove south resolving to go as far as we could.

By mid afternoon, in the early part of June, 1932, we pulled into Richfield, Utah and stopped at the post office which was the most likely place to ask for Joseph Young, one of the missionaries, who said that if we ever came west to look him up. We asked the janitor who happened to be an uncle of his and he told us that he was working with his brother, Leland Young in Vernal on a road construction. But he said that his father, A.G. Young, was just here and had just gone across the street to the bank. Seeing him out on the sidewalk, he called to him and he came across and met us. After hearing our story, he invited us to come to the south end of town and set our mobile home up on a vacant lot next to where he lived. He then invited us to take supper with him after which we told of the missionaries who had visited us and had steered us toward the Church. He mentioned his niece, Rachel Young, the daughter of the janitor, who had met us at the post office. He invited her over and Reginald took a liking to her and within three or four months they were married.	e attended Church in the First Ward Meeting house. We had become acquainted with the people but we found them quite skeptical and not too ready and willing to accept us without writing back for papers, certifying our membership. Work was now very scarce and not too well available to a new-comer. We were allowed the very first measure of welfare, an allotment of four dollars a month. But with my painting, I proved my capability to do lettering, painting, and offering meager assistance anywhere. We began to make a rather meager existance. The children born here in Richfield were: Howard Murray, April 23, 1933; Terrance Monte, August 26, 1934: Dorothy Marie, February 2, 1935: Richard Lee, November 17, 1936: and Edith Karen,
January 17, 1939.

Under the PWA administration, I signed up as self-employed painter of signs and so forth. My first job of any importance was for Charlie Card, who had desired that I paint in his basement, which he called his den, a continuos pointing on all four walls. The painting was of the Rocky Mountains; a mountain lion, bear, and other creattures of the west. My rate of earning had been established in that state amounting to six dollars per day for any all building and construction.	Now trying to get started with a home of my own, I found a location that had fallen to a doctor who had made it available to buy if I could obtain the fifty dollars. It was in the hands of the County of Sevier. I attended a meeting of the city council and in answer to my wishes to obtain the lot, my Sunday School teacher who was a member of the council, spoke for me and recommended that I be given an opportunity to earn it. Upon this I proposed to paint the library building straight across for the lot if they would supply paint.


We lived nine years in Utah. I tried very hard to become a Latter Day Saint, a member of the Mormon Church.

I was building a ceiling in the large living room in Richfield and I could not afford to buy the
necessary bundles of lath in which to lath a ceiling. The walls were adobe, they were already for plaster.	I
had seen several abandoned homes, and evidence of lath made from wollows. I asked a neighbor who had made a business in plastering if they would be suitable to build my ceiling. He prompted me that they were stronger and better, but it would take a lot of work. The willows had to be cut in the dormant stage and left to dry and it took a lot of nails. About this time, a young man came from north of Salt Lake City where his father had a coal mine. He had come down to Richfield with three ton of coal, hoping to turn it into money.		He had tried several places and finally, Alf Sharp, who I had gone hunting with several times sent him to me. I told him I needed the coal for I had built a fireplace and there was not enough heat from the kitchen stove to warm the other rooms. He caught me at a time that I had no money but still he wanted to leave the coal.	I agreed to buy it if I needed or I would try to sell it for him. He then promoted a theory that his group had decided to not wait any longer for the Church President to unite the Church membership into a “United Order”, which was a community for having everything in common. He pointed at several places in all the Church books
 
where it had been said that this had been God’s intention. I believe still is! But the Mormon people have always been dedicated to the Church Leadership in the governing of the members. Yet, he had made it look quite inviting, for he declared there was no rich or no poor among a group of one-hundred and twenty families. He thought I would be very useful to the group and there was a promise that all the needs of my entire family would be supplied without waiting.

This all “sounded good” and I carried the thought throughout the winter. Finally in the month of May, he returned. I had not sold the coal and I had not used it. He then told me that he wanted me to keep it and that I didn't owe him for it for he watched me go to great lengths to build a place for my family, he wanted to help that much.	He proceeded to have me read a letter that his first wife had written to a girl signifying that she would be willing for her to become the second wife. This began to change my opinion of his motives.	I asked him how I would fit into that sort of life for I had already ten children and what would I do with twenty? Of course, he gave me no answer. He left, but promised that he would be back at the end of the week in anticipation of my joining him with my family and belongings, including my cow and leave the unfinished house and go and join his colony. I began to ponder and weigh this very carefully. Polygamy had never fit to my liking and it was coming closer to the time of his return.

I jumped into my car and ran down to Reginald’s who was not at all well, in fact, close to death at one time but was some better now. I laid the proposition before him and the grabbed one book and then another trying to help me to arrive at some definite decision. Ordinarily, I would have stayed for there had been many times we had talked things over way into the middle of the night , but this time was different. About mid-afternoon, I said "never mind Reginald, I know what to do." I had read in the Epistle of James "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." My question was not going to be answered by man. I was ready to ask directly of God, believing that my concern was more important for my posterity than for my own desires.

At that moment I saw a spot in my mind where I had gone to many times on my way into the west mountain sometimes gathering fire wood and sometimes to hunt. It was just a little spot off the main road which was not traveled very much, bordered around with sand cut rock and dead cedar and sand. This was just a little over a mile above where I lived. I drove north, anxious to be at that spot for it burned within me as most important place to make this decision. Without a thought of home or family, I made directly for the road leading out of town up past the Natatorium a place where the public could swim, dance, etc., on up a dug way that skirted around to the right at about a sixty degree angle. My car had been in perfect condition.	It was a one seated roadster, one of the first model A's. I was making good time, when all of a sudden, I found that I was unable to steer the car. The steering wheel had actually become locked with the motor still running without my touching the clutch or shifting any gears. The car began backing down and gradually picked up speed, coasting as though there was no motor present. I fully expected at any time to run over the brink which was a hundred and fifty feet down to the level below. When I realized that I was tracking perfectly without steering I knew for sure that some miraculous power had my car in his control. The thought struck me that there would be only one who would want to discourage me and back me off from my determination. I called out declaring, "It has to be the work of Satan." Just as suddenly as before, everything went back to normal and I continued on up to the little spot where I had intended to go. I pulled off the road and parked just a little way from the main road. I turned off the engine and got out. I've very seldom if ever, in my whole life experienced being anywhere with complete silence and not a thing moving nor even the sound.	It seemed like a great vacuum and somehow supernatural. I was still bent on my purpose, so I walked past the sand cut rocks and the dead cedar trees. I was reminded of how Moses was answered out of a burning bush yet was not consumed. I felt that I would get an answer but did not know how.	A few hundred feet from my car, I picked a spot at the edge of a rock and when I got down that same old demon hovered close to me .	My mind was filled with these mocking words, "You small and insignificant being, who are you, to think that you could get to God after all the multitudes that have gone on before? And who are you to think that He would answer you." I recalled having read of Christ on the mountain and how he had been challenged by the Devil in the same manner, "Again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, and saith unto Him "All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."	I liken my situation as similar and I said "Get thee behind me Satan."
 
Addressing the father in Heaven, I stated, "You surely know why I've come and my urgent need to know what to do. For one week I have carried an increasing pressure upon my mind like carrying a bag of sand on my head becoming heavier every day." I felt exhausted and with hesitation I felt I could say	no more. I stood up and looked around. There was not a rock moved or anything at all. I turned and walked slowly back to the car.

When I had gotten within about twenty feet from the car, I began to wonder how it was going to act going down the mountain, especially if the steering wheel was still locked, I would surely wreck.	It was at that moment, when a hand rested upon my left shoulder and a thumb pressed very firmly and a voice spoke slow and loud and very clear saying "Your prayer will be answered in due time." I looked to the left but there was nothing but space, yet I felt the presence of a hand on me. After the last word was spoken, I felt greatly relieved and the pressure of indecision had been erased.	I got into my car and drove down the mountain and returned to my home just about dusk.	I threw myself across the bed and fell asleep. I was awakened shortly by my wife asking me if we could go to a movie for I had been doing sign work for the man who owned the two theaters in town and had always received a liberal amount of complimentary tickets. I remember what was showing at the Lyric Theater. It was one of the Andy Hardy movies with Mickey Rooney which had been running in series for some time. As we came out and crossed the street to the car, Marie asked me how I liked the show and I said alright I guess, but all the time I had been meditating and wondering how and when I was to be answered. Then in my own words, I spoke; saying "Now I know that Reginald Dale and we had been promised that through the affiliation of the Church, we automatically would be drafted into the House of Israel. Had we not therefore been descendants of the forerunners of the Church who had not yet come to the order where we should have all things in common?" Therefore I knew my answer to the man when he came would be NO!* This proved to be proper, for what I told him was that I would not go and he became very angry, and I knew then that I had been answered properly. This was the year of 1936, in the month of May.

Now that I had an answer, I did not completely appreciate at the time the fact that my prayer had brought me definite proof of the promise which was made unto all mankind who showed evidence of sufficient faith to ask that it would be given. This has given me a greater comfort and evidence of the Spirit which has been with me in all my problems unto this day. I surely trust that it will continue to be as I continued to be faithful in all things.

I worked at whatever was available. And I finished the big living room and built a cement porch to the front ot the house then with more adobes, I had started to build a second story. As we became more involved with the war, defense plants began to hire tradesmen- mainly in California. My half brother, Robert who was already trained was working there. Robert had gained a job and he sent a letter and advised me to come on out with plenty of work available there for anyone with experience.

Mary Margaret was born in St. Mary's Catholic Hospital in San Francisco May 18, 1942. About this time I received a letter from the town marshal of Richfield. He asked me if I had given permission to anyone or if I had made any arrangements at the high school for several of my paintings that they might be exhibited.

This was unexpected for I had boarded up the doors and windows of my deserted home in Richfield and found that the house was secure enough to leave it. I left my pictures on the walls. I went back to Richfield and found that the house was completely in ruins. After thorough investigation I found all that had happened. The officer had the names of some forty-two teenagers who had broken in and made it a meeting place and misused the place and shot out the window lights and burned the chairs and bed in the fireplace and destroyed the refrigerator and poured canned fruits into the electric stove which had been stored in the basement I salvaged what I could and moved north to Mount Pleasant, Utah. The whole state had become like a boom town, labor had become organized, my card was good anywhere. But rather than to let me work in the big project which was already started in Mr. Pleasant, they sent me to work in Ogden for the Fox Sheet Metal Company, building circular air vents for the big warehouses. It was there I obtained an injury to my right elbow from the recoil of excess hammering in the process of this building.
 
I had been injected with a drug that caused me to lose my memory and was hospitalized for four days. I decided that it was foolish for me to drive 70 miles to work and when I was told that is the way it is, I loaded up my family and moved back to Indiana. This was October 1942.

After a few inquiries, I found a big house that was for sale just across the street from where I had lived for a short time with my uncle Frank. The old home was well over a century old when we moved into it I had known the people who had lived there before the Kennedys. I had obtained work in Richmond and kept up the payments for a year or so and then
applied for a loan at Henry County Building and Loan in New Castle, Indiana. I paid on this loan for some time then asked for a separate loan of three hundred dollars to build a small house on the property which was about four and a half acres. I built the house completely myself with a basement and four rooms with bath and a small front porch. I did the wiring and the plumbing myself. I sold it for their thirty-five hundred dollars and surveyed and gave the deed to a young couple just married Right after moving into the old house, I took work in Connersville, just twelve miles from Cambridge at the Auburn
Plant making cars.

This house was completely round when first built, over the years it has been modified, this photo was taken in 2003

In 1943, our daughter Joann died with diabetes. When the war had come on, my sheet metal experience afforded me an opportunity to hire in where defense work was available in many places. I adopted a habit of changing work location to better my status.

In 1946 our fourteenth child, Samuel Johnathan was born the first day of June. He died on the first day of September that same year. He could not make enough blood to sustain himself.

In 1947 I hired on at Johns Manville, which eventually became the last place I worked prior to coming west the second time to live. I was hired by a man named Rab Stanley. He advised me of the system that they had adopted where a man could be hired in as a third-class Mill Wright and could make a $1.15 per hour. I told him that I preferred to start at this rate and made a bargain with him that I should be raised to this class as I proved out At that time they had been working under a small independent union known as Stone Felt They had been developing rock wool insulation in a branch in Richmond It was the best type of insulation known in the world at that time.

About my fourth year there, a man from New Jersey by the name of Clayton Powell hired on. He was a genious who converted the process of breaking down molten rock that had been blown by steam jets onto a conveyer forming a bat of insulation. He was a man that would get so engrossed with his work, that he would drive down town for his dinner and take a bus back to the factory without remembering he had taken his car.	At
 
a later date, when we had established a dining hall on the grounds of the factory, he was known to go to lunch and then return later for another, not realizing he had already been there. I worked at this factory for twelve years and left at the age of sixty.

In 1949 our last child, Deborah Ann was born January 23. By now, in Cambridge I had remodeled the big ten room house and removed the upper story and roof, making the home a ranch type building and two car garage and studio.

I had been teaching fine art I had been teaching since 1933 when I lived in Utah. I had formed a club in Cambridge which was called the Wayne County Realistic Club formed by those whom I had been teaching from Richmond and Cambridge and

nearby communities.
 

We had gone many times on field trips where I was teaching them how to get a picture without a camera, but merely by sketch. We had gone many miles into several locations capturing a replica of the covered bridges of Indiana which some had been torn down some them burned down, but now after starting a specialty and having painted several of the bridges, I was known to display them on highway 40 at a restaurant known as the Coffee Pot Inn, where I would hang two covered bridges at a time and in the following week or so I would replace them with a couple I had done more recently. This I had done over a period of two or three years. I eventually acquired recognition as the covered bridge artist.

Photo of H.N. covered bridge sent to me by Leah Huddleston 2010.
 
I had periodically held an art show of my work with the students work, either shown on my lawn or in the park which began to prove most affective in promoting me among the public as an art teacher as well as an artist. During this time, someone told me that "Success is relative, if you are successful, relatives move in." This was the case when I had several of them come from a great distance trying to show evidence of their relationship to me, which in most cases I could trace and indentify in my Huddleston Family Tables compiled by my grandfather Samuel Brown Huddleston.

In 1961 the city scheduled a 125 Centennial for Cambridge City. The members of the chamber of Commerce, including my banker, proposed that I should paint The old Grietz’s Grist Mill from the only existant black and white post card. This old building was well steeped in my mind. It was an old land mark where I had repaired the galvanized roofing and many blower pipes from time to time. I also remember the lake where one row boat lay a drift among the willows along the bank. The arrangement was made that if I would paint a canvas depicting this old mill site as it looked when in process they would show it for several weeks prior to the time of the Centennial. I painted it on a 30X36 canvas. While it was on exhibit, they had it reproduce and printed on the front cover of the Lincoln High School Yearbook. Mrs. Cecil Cohee committee chair had obtained the whereabouts of all the children who had attended the school, which included two of my own children. Beulah graduated in 1946 and Norman graduated in 1950. They also published all the people of the town dating back to the town’s birth and had many photos, places of business and advertisements, as well as one of my own, which featured the painting of my wife, Marie.

The advertisement was as follows:

Realistic Fine Art Studio Portraits, Landscapes Favorite Landmarks by Order

My location for the exhibit of twenty one of my paintings was near the old mill pond site. I had recently done a painting of Emmet Kelley, the clown. One of the roustabouts who had helped set a carnival near the site came through my exhibit one day and told me that he had worked for three years in the carnival where Kelly worked and as he looked at the painting, with tears in his eyes he said,”He does everything but talk.”

I have left paintings in the new Lincoln High School, the pavilion at Glen Miller Park in Richmond as well as one at White Water Park. I left a painting of Mrs. Fisher at Fisher’s Mortuary in Cambridge and a painting in California of the LDS Church in San Francisco, depicting Lehi’s dream taken from the Book of Mormon. Another painting of the Canadian Scene at Macanaw Canada and a portrait of these people from Johns Manville: Pat Murphy, and Ruth Christensen and Robert Maddix, draftsman for the plant.

In 1963 I decided to go west for health reasons. The hot humid summers in Indiana and the long cold periods with snow on the ground in winter seemed to keep me on the sick list. We sold our home and bought a mobile home and moved it to New Mexico. I was privileged to meet Fred Harmen, an artist who was well established
and the originator of the Little Beaver and Rider comic strips.

Once in New Mexico I bought a lot south of Albuquerque on Highway 85 in Los Lunas, New Mexico. I set up a studio and very quickly acquired students. Mrs. John Love was my first student. When Debie graduated high school in 1967, I asked her to become a partner in teaching. We called the club Mid Valley Artists’s club. We started with a membership of twelve, quickly climbing to 40. We have had several successful exhibits in this valley and we are now in the process of arranging another.

In 1969 we were privileged to take a trip back to Indiana where most of our children live and held a reunion. We are proud to
 
claim now that we are the grandparents of thirty two, great grandparents of nine at last count.

I am now in the process of demonstrating how to paint a portrait from a live subject to my students who want to become portrait artists. The portrait I am painting is of a local artist and friend from Belen, L.A. (Hank McCormick). He and I intend to hunt and fish together in the near future.

It is now the latter part of 1973, we are planning to take another trip to Indiana for a reunion for this is our 50th year of marriage.	Last April we were surprised to be honored with an anniversary celebration given us by the students and people we have come to know in our years in this state.

We are now one year later in August of 1974. I had intended to end the story of my life at this point, I find that we have accomplished more in this one year. However, we did make the trip back to Indiana. We were honored by our children and grandchildren with a reunion celebrating our Golden Wedding Anniversary. We found that we more than likely could not endure the climate there or would have been able to survive it for the past ten years.

Our studio and our club has survived and we are continuing with two exhibits annually. Each exhibit seems to prove greater achievement by all. Most favorably, we find where we are making head way as far as the general public concerned. For they have come from all parts of the state seeming to have an eye on the type of art we do and teach.

While I was in the east, many years ago, it had long been my desire to paint some of the Indian art of weaving and pottery and this has become a dream come true now, through the extent that many of the tribes from Arizona and New Mexico have revised their ancient art and applied new designs and techniques; and it has been appearing in the Arizona Highways Magazine which I have used for many years as a guide line of photographic values from which to paint and teach.
 

The coming fall exhibit which will occur in mid-October of this year, will show much of this Indian art, mainly pottery. We have re-produced it in what we think is a better composition than they have photographed it.
We had acquired a special location in which to exhibit and have an indefinite privilege to call it the Mid Valley Art Center. Having passed my 72nd birthday, I ‘m glad to say that I have planned out and done more in the way
of improving my home, studio and business, that any other year previous.

My ultimate aim has been to guide and inspire to any and all of my posterity, hoping to guide and direct a smoother path through life, knowing that having found God as the key to success in life and the assurance of life eternal.

NOTES ON MY BEGINNINGS BY MARIE E. MOORE

My first recollections is living on a farm in Wayne County Indiana. This farm was situated on a road called Hunnicutt, named after the Hunnnicutt’s our next door neighbors. They owned a beautiful big house with a big fireplace in the living room made with a marble face and hearth.

I must have been very young because Mrs. Hunnicutt gave me a set of blocks to play with on a lovely plush rug in front of the fireplace. My mother told me I picked up the block that had a church on it and held in my left hand while I played with the other blocks with my right hand. I remember mother had to take it away from me, when we left.	Mrs. Hunnicutt told her that meant I would cleave to the Church all my life.

My father bought a book from a salesman called “The Life of Christ” when I was three years old.	It was kept on an
antique stand never read only dusted and put back. I remember being curious about it. I would thumb
through the pages of it when I dusted it. I never attempted to read it until I was nine. I was reading everything I found when I took the book of Christ off the stand and read it through. I remember crying my heart out when I read the persecution and death of Christ. I fell in love with Jesus then and I have loved him ever since. The precepts that Jesus taught on the Mt. of Olives seemed to be something I had heard before and I believe them sincerely.

We lived on this farm until I was almost 7 years old. We moved to Cambridge City, two miles from the farm.
I remember many things about the farm, a red brick house with a breeze way, open to the south and big wooden doors to the north. In the breezeway was a big Iron pump that I couldn’t pump until I was about five years old. The water was cold it made my teeth ache. The water ran into a trough into a springhouse where my mother kept her cream and milk cold and sweet and the butter she churned from the cream. She had a churn that looked like a small barrel with a tight lid that clamped on with iron clamps. It had a handle and sat on a platform with two sturdy leg braced with wood between them. I sat on a stool and turned the handle from the time I was around four years old. The handle turned the churn over and over. I remember it would take quite awhile and I would get a little restless. I would ask my mama is it butter and she told me when it went ca-thud it was butter, but I had to turn a few more turns to get the butter gathered, then I was through. Mother would take the butter out with a wooden paddle in a big wooden bowl and work all the buttermilk out and wash it with cold water until there was no milk left in it. Then she sprinkle salt and work that in. She said if you have any milk left it would turn the butter sour. I remember how I loved the butter milk with corn bread or ginger bread. She made the most delicious soda biscuits I ever ate. She showed me how to open the biscuits with- out making them soggy. They would open so flaky, they melted in your mouth, with home- made butter and jellies or jams, that she made herself. This little girl believed her mother was the greatest cook on earth and still does. She made the most delicious three layer chocolate cakes with carmel icing or served with whipped cream. No wonder I was chubby!

The following picture was updated by Sharon Ogzewalla - Marie was dress in blue silk dress when Howard first met her.  

Mother baked her yeast bread and kept in a 50 lb. Lard can so it would be moist. She had old white sheets to wrap it in. You see in those days we did not have wax paper or paper towels or toilet tissue and tissues.	I remember Mama washing and boiling the ragged sheets when she felt they needed it. You see there was butter on the crust and the rags would get to smelling strong. I remember her boiling the dish towel & cloths. She had a copper boiler that she heated her wash water in, she would also boil her white thins in the same boiler. The wash water was rain water from a cistern which was soft water. She had a hand washer with corrugated slats put on metal to hold the slats in place. Then there was a kind of a rocker that fitted in the washer with slats that rumbled the clothes clean. Of course you worked it by hand. There was a wringer that turned with a crank that would have to wring the clothes by hand. It was hard on buttons so we would have to turn them inside out so the wring would not pop them off.


 


SAMUEL, ORPHA CRAIG & MARIE MOORE

AGE 20

 

Picture researched and submitted by Leah Huddleston 2010

 
Marie Moore was born to Samuel Moore a nd Orpha Craig Moore 21 April, 1907 in Cambridge City, Indiana she died in January 1984.

We know that the Moore’s were not Catholic, since they came from Northern Ireland and those settling that area were definitely protestant and were from Scotland, which is why Jane Hamilton referred to herself as Scotch-Irish in the Moore Family history.

Andrew Moore, Marie’s grandfather immigrated from Ireland in 1852. Jane Hamilton and Andrew were married in Newtonards, Down, Ireland in 1850. I do not know why Andrew and Jane made their home in Cambridge City, an hour or so away from the Moore Family hub; the majority of whom settled in and around the Oxford, Ohio area.
 
 
ANDREW MOORE’S CITIZENSHIP PAPERS SENT TO ME BY DEBORAH HUDDLESTON GORMAN


Andrew also served in the Civil War enlisting in the Indiana 124th Infantry.	If records, or writings had been kept on this side of the family we might have learned what split this family apart, for Jane and her children were not living with Andrew in the 1870 census records. The census records of 1860 show a David Moore age 1, but I did not find mention of him in later censuses.	I can only speculate that a death of a child, and the father’s enlistment in 1864, may have been hard on the family.

Samuel Moore, Marie’s father did not marry until he was 48 years of age. He and Orpha married 4 March, 1904. Orpha had been married before to Samuel Griffith, by whom she had 2 sons. Charles M. and Delmar C. Griffith. Delmar would have been 12 years old when Marie was born. I do not know the reason for the divorce from Samuel. My grandmother never talked about her half brothers, or any of her family for that matter.

Despite the fact that Samuel was 18 years Orpha’s senior, he outlived her until 1930. Orpha died in 1922 from cancer leaving 15 year old Marie who headed to Kentucky four days after she turned 16 to marry Howard.
 
THE MALONEY QUAKER CONNECTION

The Maloney line has been a difficult line to research, but until I dug into the research, very little was known about this family and it’s origins. Many people have been reluctant to talk about any history of this family and or have not been interested in it’s origins.
To date, we still have not made the Irish connection, although any number of family members will tell you the “name is Irish and their grandfather came over from Ireland”. The truth is John Maloney is five generations back and all his desc endants were born in Kentucky.		We are not sure if John himself was also born in the states. The records become very scarce after the 1800’s and so far we have not been able to connect him to Ireland. This line has not revealed any preference of religion, and the dysfunction from intermarrying in the secluded area of Breathitt County, Kentucky shows more confusion and chaos than any of the lines I have researched. The other related lines that I researched very little, include the Bryant line. our great gran dfather, Mcdonaldson married Sabrina Bryant.	I was sent some information about this line from a man who was doing extensive research in order to establish this line to one of Daniel Boone’s sisters.	I have not verified this line as well, but if this is c orrect, it will again connect us to a Quaker line, for the Bboone’s came from England and were Quakers .

A PERSON DOING METICULOUS RESEARCH ON THE WILCOXON/BRYANT/BOONE LINES
 
UNKNOWN AND RACHEL ( WILCOXSON) MYLAR

The last name could have been spelled Milar or Mylar. There was a Mylar in Pennsylvania in 1700 development of Kentucky. One story is that he worked on the “Wilderness Trail” which ran from South Carolina to Kentucky. At a later date it is believed he was, also, a good friend of William Briant.

Unknown Mylar married Rachel Wilcoxson about 1781 in Virginia near Fort Boonesborough. Rachel was the daughter of John Wilcoxson and Sarah Boone. The couple moved from Virginia to South Carolina, where their first son James was born about 1782. Unknown Mylar died in Kentucky during an attack by Indians in 1789. Rachel (Wilcoxson) Mylar’s second marriage was to William Briant in 1790 in Kentucky. The courthouse in Fayette County burned in 1803 and all records were lost. The Bryant’s first born child was in 1791.

Let’s see how other authors viewed the events.

The Boone Family by Hazel Spraker
Page 65) William Briant led a group to Kentucky in 1779. “It is quite possible that in the party of kindred were William Bryant and his wife Rachel Wilcoxson”. Quite possible means that I do not know. Rachel and William’s first child was born in 1791. If the above was true why or how would they wait eleven years to have their first child in 1791 and then eight in twelve years?
Page 107) “Rachel Wilcoxson married William Bryant who was born 1739 in Wales”. But in William’s application for a pension he stated on June 25, 1833, his age was seventy-nine. “I was born in Orange County, North Carolina, in 1754”.
Page 108) “William Bryant was a captain in the Revolutionary War under Colonel Todd and Boone”. William stated that he was in the service in February 1780 for eight months as a private under Captain Enoch Enochs. In January 1781, he was in the service as a private under Captain Hemphill and Captain John Dial. William was still a private in the military when he was sent to New York in the winter of 1782 just before his discharge.

Missouri Historical Review, vol 3, p 46, October 1908 – July 1909
William Bryant had returned to Kentucky at the close of the Revolutionary War. “During these early times he took part in several engagements with the Indians, holding the rank of Captain under the command of Colonel Todd and Boone”. William was a Captain after the Revolutionary War when fighting Indians in the State Militia.
William Bryant could not read or even write his name.

The same material word for word that is in the Spraker book can be found in the book Boone’s by Sarah Rochenfield on pages 359, 361, and Wilcoxson and Allied Families by Dorothy Wulfack on pages 24, 25, 26. None took the time to check for possible errors, but repeated hearsay information.
The dates have been reevaluated on the birth of Rachel Wilcoxson to 1762 and the birth of her son James to
be 1782. In the 1700’s a taxable person was a white male sixteen years or older. James was on the Kentucky tax rolls in 1799 and 1800. He would have been eighteen in 1800 and twenty-four when he married in 1806.

Unknown Mylar and Rachel Wilcoxson had two known children. James Mylar, their first child, was born in South Carolina in about 1782. In about 1784 the Mylar family moved to Fayette County, Kentucky. Rachel Milar/Mylar, their daughter, was born in Kentucky about 1789. Rachel Milar/Mylar married Stephen Jett on February 24, 1806, and James Mylar married Henrietta Jett on October 2, 1806. Both marriages were in Madison County, Kentucky. Henrietta Jett was born in Virginia (later Kentucky) and was the daughter of Isaac Israel Jett and Mary Letcher.

The Unknown Mylar, while in the wilderness in about 1789, was killed during an attack by Indians. A year later his wife Rachel married William Briant in 1790.
In the books and articles of Ed Bates, Wilcoxson and Allied Families by Dorothy Wulfack, Norma Nyberg of
Missouri, and “Boone’s Sierra Echoes” all list the probable children of William Bryant. The names of the
 
children were compiled by descendant one hundred years after William’s death. Some children are listed in the will of William Bryant. Another source was John Ellis, when he was trying to settle the estate. Only three of the children have known birthdays. There is no way to prove or disprove the rest of the children of Rachel and William Bryant. I am placing a letter in the appendix, it is on page 103, from J Samuel Smart of New York who is related to R&W Bryant. He believes that the children George, William, and Elizabeth are niece and nephews of William Bryant, not his children.
Rachel is established as a Wilcoxson related to the Boone family. Her second marriage was to William Bryant. The enclosed marriage consent document shows Rachel Bryant to be the mother of Rachel Mylar. This confirms that Rachel had a first marriage to a Mylar before that of William Bryant in 1790.

Lydia (Neal) Mylar, in about 1906, decided to write down her story of the Mylar family. Near the beginning she states, “The Mylar family was related to Daniel Boone by marriage”.
A quote from Some of Her Life Experiences by Dr. Owens-Adair on page 213.
“Mrs. Rachel (Mylar) Kindred was born in Kentucky in 1822, and is the great-grand niece of the celebrated Daniel Boone”. Rachel is the daughter of James and Henrietta Mylar.
In order to be a great-grand niece of Daniel Boone the relationship would be as follows. Sister
Daniel Boone Brother Sarah Boone (M) John Wilcoxson Niece Rachel Wilcoxson (M) Unknown Mylar
Grand Nephew James Mylar (M) Henrietta Jett
Great-Grand Niece Rachel Mylar (M) B Kindred

Copy of the marriage consent document for Rachel Milar/Mylar to marry Stephen Jett was found in Madison County, Kentucky. Rachel Milar/Mylar is the daughter of Rachel (Wilcoxson, Mylar) Briant
. In the above the (I) is crossed out and (we) was inserted meaning that more than one person is giving permission. The marriage consent in 1806 for Rachel Milar/Mylar and Stephen Jett to marry was given by her mother, Rachel (Wilcoxson, Mylar) Briant and stepfather William Briant. James Mylar, brother of Rachel Milar/Mylar, signed as a witness to the marriage consent in Madison County, Kentucky in 1806. Neither Rachel nor William Briant could write their names then who signed their names. At the bottom of the above document “Sworn to” is a verbal promise of approval. The signatures are written by James Milan, the
minister, taking the verbal statement and seem to be the person that wrote the whole consent form except for James Mylar and James Ryley. James Milan changed the Y’s to I’s in the spelling of Milar and Briant.
In the book Early Kentucky Marriages, by Annie Bell, she states the marriage of “Stephen Jett to Rachel Miller
was February 24, 1806, her father was James Miller” Marriage Consent Form

Annie Bell in her book made a number of errors that are now being passed on for others to repeat the same mistakes.
1.	The first mistake was to change the spelling of the names from that which appeared on the marriage
consent document. The name Rachel Milar/Mylar and James Mylar were changed to read MILLER.
2.	With the name change the author could make James Miller the father of Rachel Miller. In reality James and Rachel are brother and sister.
3.	Rachel Milar/Mylar married Stephen Jett in February 1806, and her brother James Mylar married Henrietta
Jett in October 1806. Therefore James Mylar could not be the father of Rachel Milar/Mylar.
4.	James Mylar and James Ryley signed under the heading (Teste). They were the witnesses to the marriage document.
5.	Looking at the document the word “I” is marked out and the word “we” is inserted. This means that more than one person gave their permission for the marriage.
A.	The only persons who could consent to the marriage were Rachel’s mother Rachel (Wilcoxson, Mylar)
Bryant and stepfather William Bryant.

EULOGY FOR WANDA

Oct 19 2005
Delivered by Howard Murray Huddleston

Proverbs 31:10-15, 17-21, 25-31


Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies.
The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
She seeketh woold, and flax and worketh willingly with her hands.
She is like a merchant’s ship and bringeth her food from afar.
She ariseth also while it is yet light and and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
She girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms.
She percieveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.
Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou exceelest them all.
Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but the woman who feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.
Give her the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.


My sister Wanda, was truly a Virtuous woman-I'd like to tell you about some of her greatest virtues:

Hard Working
Started Young - Paper Route, Ironing Money, Blue jean Creases.	She had 10 children and cared for them and the grandchildren And never said no. She was a perfectionist in all she did. We all have some of her wood creations, made with skill and love.

Generous
We all have experienced Wanda's willingness to prepare big meals-our family experienced this in Florida one year-she had a big lasagna dinner waiting for us when we got to the house late one evening. She always shared her home and what she had.

Humble
Wanda always gave help to others but was always quiet about it and never sought any recognition or even appreciation.

Devoted to Family
While Wanda and Taylor lived in Florida she had the coffee table piled with photo albums of her
children and grandchildren.	They were her life.	She showed her love to all of us in very practical ways. Wanda was wise and a good listener.	She gave good advice to her children and grandchildren
And prayed for all of them to live Godly lives.


Courageous & Strong
Wanda truly showed us all how to be strong and courageous in difficult circumstances. She faced serious health problems for at least 20 years. In the past couple of years she was a real fighter and suffered painful treatments to survive.
 

We have truly been blessed by God for having her as a sister, wife, mother, grandmother, and friend. We can use her example and honor her by living virtuous lives. This song expresses how I feel we should all live in the coming Days:
"Be strong in the Lord, and be of good courage Your mighty Defender is always the same. Mount up with wings, as the eagle ascending Victory is sure when you call on His name.

So put on the armor the Lord has provided And place your defense in His unfailing care. Trust Him, for He will be with you in battle. Lighting your path to avoid every snare.

Be strong in the Lord, and be of good courage Your mighty Commander will vanquish the foe. Fear not the battle, for the victory is always His. He will protect you wherever you go."

One day in spring when our eyes met Words didn't need to be spoken
A union was planned by God
And our vows were never to be broken

There were to be many hard times And many burdens would test our love
At times we would bend, but we never broke Like the perfect fit, we are a hand in glove.


Throught the years we had many children And raised them the best we could
If asked would we do it over again
answer is, without a doubt we would!

10/19/05 1:30 PM

In Indiana on August 21, 1928 Wanda Mae Huddleston was born. Her father was a professional artist. He provided for his family through his creative talent as a portrait painter. Wanda was one of thirteen children in her family.

I've been told that Wanda was the first girl to deliver newspaper in her town. It was on her paper route that her life took a surprising turn. One of her patrons was the Maloney family. Young Taylor Hershel Maloney had just returned from the WWII as a staff Sergeant. He served our country in 7 major campaigns including Normandy's D Day. She was 18, he was 24. As the newspaper was being delivered one day he saw this beautiful young girl. He asked his parents who this enterprising girl was. Nearly a month passed and Taylor's father got sick. Taylor was asked to run the store. Wanda came into the store one day to trade for food.
Taylor claims that he fell in love with her the first time they talked. They got briefly acquainted; he invited her to the fair. That must have been a very special fair because ten days later they were married. They were
married by a preacher at his father's house.
Taylor's oldest sister was married at the same time with them.

And, as they say, the rest is history. On August 31s' of this year they celebrated their 59th Anniversary.

They soon began their family -. which eventually boasted 10 children, 32 grandchildren, and 31 great grandchildren.

Wanda was always busy. She worked both in and out of the home. She was the primary care giver to the children, keeping the home clean and the kids nurtured, loved, and cared for.
She was a crossing-guard for the neighborhood school, she delivered Newspapers, worked at the Election Polls, took in Ironing. She baby-sat eleven kids in her home, even after having 10 of her own.
Wanda Maloney's life was all about her husband, children, and grandchildren. Their house was always the hub of all kinds of activities. Their table was always welcoming to any friend or stranger that happened by. Someone once called the Maloney home the "Kool-Aid" home because all the neighborhood children knew they could find a snack and drink there.

Her children will all remember her delicious Cherry Cobbler. Trips to the Pony keg for chocolate malts, peanut butter fudge, popcorn balls and apples. Each Friday held a special treat. Wanda would rifle through the pockets of her husband's pants for money as he was sleeping and she would take the kids out to the bakery and buy fresh-made donuts. Each time she would cautiously remind her children, "Don't tell Dad."
Wanda was not your run-of-the-mill type of mother. How do I know? What other mother do you know who kept her band-saw in her kitchen? That's right. Band Saw. You might have noticed in the northex that Wanda was a (crafts-woman) who loved to work with wood. One Christmas she asked her children for one gift alone ... a Band Saw. Where would a woman keep her band saw? Well, where it was convenient to use, of course ... the kitchen.
 

I can only imagine that after the breakfast dishes were cleared one could hear the buzz of the saw, chiseling out the shape of a horse or paddle-boat. Wanda made many gifts of love and skill and gave them to her family and friends. Cherish these things.

The children of Wanda Maloney pretty much all agree that their mother was on mission to spoil their children. Oh, how did Wanda love her grandchildren and her great grandchildren! She would rise early to make her famous French Toast for breakfast for them. She would sneak snacks and cater in any way she could to her grandchildren. There was always a game available to play or a picture ready to be colored. She was always ready for a game of cards, Yatzee, 500 Rummy, Dominoes - Chicken Foot. Even when she was alone you could find her playing her hand held Yatzee game. SHE NEVER WAS IDLE.

 







pragmatic and practical.
 
Wanda never saw a stranger. She would have conversations with anyone she met. Sometimes ",spilling the beans" of whatever was happening in her life. She always befriended everyone. She loved people.
Wanda loved Lighthouses and Thomas Kincade paintings. Wanda was a strong woman who spoke her mind. She was a realist and very
 

Thirteen years ago another milestone took place in her life, which change the direction of her path. At a Christmas program, here in this church sanctuary, she knelt at an altar of prayer and received Jesus Christ as her personal Savior and Lord.

The Wanda Maloney I knew these past few years was a strong woman of faith. She trusted in God to meet her need. She was always grateful to the Lord for his provisions in her life.

She was quick to praise God and to express her love for Christ. Some of her final words here on earth were the uttering of "Hallelujah, Hallelujah!” as all of the family members gathered in her room for one final farewell before she died.

A few months after their conversion, both Wanda and Taylor were baptized in the Christian Faith. Children, your mother was a strong woman and a tenacious fighter. We could especially see her determination these past few weeks. She fought for every day, every breath.

This past week you gave your mother a very precious gift. As you surrounded her in her hospice room you gave her permission to let go. You reminded her that she had fought a good fight. You let her know that it was OK for her to rest in the arms of Jesus.

From that moment we saw Wanda Maloney slip from this world to the next. She is now at home in heaven. Jesus tells us that he has gone to prepare a place for us ... a mansion. She has seen Jesus face to face. We can be sure that she is in a better place.

Let it be said of her that she loved and adored her family.
 
Wanda was first baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints by her father and considered herself a member as she stated to Sharon until her death in 2005. She was not active throughout her life in this or any other church, but her kind and tender spirit is evidence of her love of the Savior regardless of any particular beliefs.

How we live our lives and keep our covenants is what sets us apart from the rest of the world. For various reasons, my mother’s focus of spiritual matters had been broken and her testimony of Christ was not nutured during her marriage to our father, nor were religious values taught to us.	Nonetheless, my most important and earliest memories of my mother was of her reading the Bible to us at a very young age and the next important memory is when some men from a neighboring church had stopped by to visit and encourage religious teachings in our home.	They asked if they could do anything for the family, and mom told them that I was sick. They asked if they could pray over me and ask for a blessing for me. I will never forget the feelings and stirrings of belief in the Savior from the experiences of Mom reading the bible and having someone pray for me. Thus began my desire to know more about the Savior and his teachings.

Paragraphs from my personal Journal 1999

My mother was seriously ill two months ago and I was called to come in case these were to be her final moments on this earth. We were all so worried about her and I anticipated a funeral while I was there. Miraculously, she recovered and so my sisters and I could relax a bit and enjoy one another's company. I live a great distance from my sisters and they are fun people to be around. They wanted to do things to celebrate the change of circumstances in my mothers’ health by going to the beach on Sunday. As we sat at dinner that Saturday evening and discussed plans for the following day I realized that I needed to make it understood that I would not be joining them that I intended to go to Church instead. Inside my heart I struggled so much with wanting to be a part of their festivities as well as have their acceptance. Years and miles and differences of opinion had separated us for so long and I desired to be in their company and enjoy our sisterhood, but I promptly asked my mother for the name of her home teacher and made arrangements to get to church.	The next day was a spiritually enlightening one for me and the Spirit testified to me all during the meetings that I was doing the right thing by honoring my covenant with the Lord by keeping the Sabbath day holy.

I did not realize until a few days later how this would impact my mother. She took note of the difference in how I observed Sunday. My mother had just had a miraculous recovery from a serious illness due to a priesthood blessing and I think she was realizing her neglectfulness in showing appreciation to the Lord for this blessing. After everyone had left and she and I had some quiet time to talk, she said to me- "I should have gone to church with you on Sunday." She did not say- I should have gone to the beach with my sisters where they had a fun day and enjoyed each other’s company, but I should have gone to church with you.	She saw a need to make changes in her life and made a commitment to do so, while I was there.	A standard had been noted. The spirit continues to testify to me how important it is for me to continue to keep my covenants to remember Him and to keep the Sabbath day holy and to be obedient to His commandments, for this is how we continue to remember and show our love to Him.”

Deuteronomy 7:9

Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations.
 
NOTES:

Editor’s note: #1
Unfortunately; In 1976 Debie and Grandma decided to flee to a more peaceful environment.	Despite the wonderful productive life that Howard has painted in his autobiography, there were many problems associated with living with him. Those who lived with him could rightfully call him difficult, demanding and tyrannical.
Age compounded all those characteristics and made it even more difficult to reason with him.	Debie and Marie left him for many reasons and that is their story to tell. The reader may notice that Howard only talks of himself and his accomplishments and barely mentions his wife and children or the home environment.


It may be shocking for some to realize that Howard and Marie were married for 54 years and then divorced.	It is not a surprise to also notice in my research that there were a few other couples who also divorced.
Johnathan Huddleston had a similar temperament to Howard’s and he and his wife were not living together in
their later years. I did not search for divorce papers, but they each were living with different family members in the 1860 census record.	I also found that Andrew and Jane Moore, parents of Samuel Moore, our great grandfather were not living in the same household in their later years and they did get a divorce.	Orpha Craig Moore, Marie’s mother, also was divorced and Samuel was her second husband.

Family life is frought with problems and if husbands and wives do not cherish each other and love and nurture their children then this is often the consequence. Families can bring us the greatest joy in life or the greatest sorrow.	How we conduct our lives has an impact on not just us, but family members and indeed generations. Howard valued Christianity in his life, he just did not know how to implement it in his relationships.	When we do not make it an effort to practice these Christian values in our relationships with family members, where they are most needed, then it opens the door for chaos, insecurity for our children and desperate measures to separate ourselves from the abuser. It has not been my focus in compiling this family information to dwell on the negative aspects of people’s lives, but to show the examples of faithfulness that we are descended from and to encourage future generations to learn from their ancestors, know that you are loved, and your life matters- especially how you choose to live your life because it will impact your descendants as well.	I pray for each of you to have courage as you go forward, knowing there are others on the other side who are also praying for you and your success.
Love, Sharon
September, 2008
 
NOTE #2

I include this Declaration in regards to the man who came to Howard about joining his polygamous community. The following is an official declaration made by President Wilford Woodruff in 1890 regarding polygamy. There were some members of the Church who were so committed to the practice that they refused to obey this declaration. Those members who were non compliant with this manifesto were then summarily
ex-communicated from the Church and the Church has no affiliation with them whatsoever.	The earlier beliefs cause some confusion in today’s world, as many fundamentalists are practicing polygamy – they are in no way affliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

#Official Declaration 1

To Whom It May Concern

Press dispatches having been sent for political purposes, from Salt Lake City, which have been widely published, to the effect that the Utah Commission, in their recent report to the Secretary of the Interior, allege that plural marriages are still being solemnized and that forty or more such marriages have been contracted in Utah since last June or during the past year, also that in public discourses the leaders of the Church have taught, encouraged and urged the continuance of the practice of polygamy-

I, therefore, as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, do hereby, in the most solemn manner, declare that these charges are false. We are not teaching polygamy or plural marriage, nor permitting any person to enter into its practice, and I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any other place in the Territory.

One case has been reported, in which the parties allege that the marriage was performed in the Endowment House, in Salt Lake City, in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who performed the ceremony; whatever was done in this matter was without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence the Endowment House was, by my instructions, taken down without delay.

Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise. There is nothing in my teachings to the Church or in those of my associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably construed to inculcate or encourage polygamy; and when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey any such teaching, he has been promptly reproved. And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.

Wilford Woodruff

President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Lorenzo Snow offered the following
"'I move that, recognizing Wilford Woodruff as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the only man on the earth at the present time who holds the keys of the sealing ordinances, we consider him fully authorized by virtue of his position to issue the Manifesto which has been read in our hearing, and which is dated September 1890, and that as a Church in General Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning plural marriages as authoritative and binding.'
"The vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous. "Salt Lake City, Utah, October 6, 1890.
 
#Quakers

Internet Wikepedia

The Quakers began in England in the early 1650s as a Nonconformist movement separate from other such movements, from Anglicanism and from Roman Catholicism. Some would say that it was not precisely a "break" from any of these, but was organized outside of them. Traditionally George Fox has been taken to be the founder or at least the most important early figure, but modern scholarship suggests a more complicated picture. Most likely, a number of radical Puritans, among them Fox, James Nayler and Edward Burrough, independently came to similar positions, eventually came into contact with one another, and then began to coordinate their preaching. However, since Fox outlived most of what some Quakers have called the Valiant Sixty---a group of early Quaker evangelists---his account of the early days as recorded in his Journal, while it may exaggerate his role, is the most detailed one available.

The Valiant Sixty believed that direct experience with God was available to all people, without any mediation
(e.g. through a pastor, or through sacraments). Friends have often expressed this belief by referring to "that of God in Everyone", "inner light", "inward Christ", "the spirit of Christ within", and many other terms.

Fox left home at age 19 in 1644 on a religious search that lasted about three years, until he reported hearing the voice of Christ, and undergoing a process of personal transformation by the workings of the "inward light". He began preaching publicly in 1648. At that time, Puritanism was predominant in England under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, but religious dissent and political dissent were increasing. Fox was a highly vocal dissenter, as he considered many of the religious practices of the time to be inconsistent with Christian faith. In particular, he rejected the notion of a paid priesthood and of governmentally sanctioned church buildings (which he derided as "steeple-houses"), believing instead that everyone can be a minister and that any worshipful gathering of true Christians is equally legitimate. Thus, traditional Quaker worship had no individual in charge of conducting a planned service; instead, worshippers gathered in silence, which was only interrupted when someone in attendance felt moved by the Spirit to speak. Fox also believed the Puritans were wrong to regard literal reading of Scripture as a higher authority than personal experience of the divine, quoting Paul's statement in 2 Corinthians that "the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life."

He began his career by speaking in outdoor public places and in congregations—something he continued to do throughout his life. In many cases this resulted in his abuse and imprisonment—especially when he came into "steeple-houses" to denounce the sermons after the minister had finished, which was the custom and legal during the Commonwealth. From 1652 onward Fox was closely associated with an earlier, very loosely organized movement of religious dissenters, the Seekers. Seekers typically believed that there was no true church in existence, and resigned themselves to waiting for God to reestablish his kingdom, either spiritually or temporally. They had many practices that were similar to the emerging Quaker movement; they had discarded all ceremony in worship and begun the practice of silent meetings which, as Fox rapidly gained followers among the Seekers, became the practice of Friends.

Fox was equally critical of many aspects of English culture besides religious dogma, particularly those that he saw as symptoms of pride and misuse of authority. In 1661, he and other leading Quakers made their first public profession of the peace testimony; it is unclear how universal pacifism was before then, many Quaker converts being sympathetic with the Puritan revolution or even members of the New Model Army, as James Nayler was. After that point, the Quakers maintained that the proper response to injustice was neither violence nor acquiescence, but peaceful non-cooperation. Fox's criticisms of his society were similar to those of the Seekers, Ranters, and Levellers, and he drew followers from all of these groups (as well as from dissatisfied members of Cromwell's movement), but differed from them in his urgent call for a revival of what he saw as original Christian faith and practice, based on obedience to the inwardly revealed word of God and public resistance to injustice. Early Friends saw themselves as "primitive Christianity revived", in William Penn's words, and saw their Puritan and Anglican persecutors as analogous to the Pharisees.
 
##Facts About Friends

by Ted Hoare
Member of Australia Yearly Meeting


WELCOME TO OUR MEETING

This leaflet provides a brief introduction to the Religious Society of Friends and we hope it will stimulate requests for further information which is available in other publications.


OUR CHRISTIAN BACKGROUND

The origins of the Society are found in the seventeenth century in England, a time when many were questioning the established beliefs of the age.

George Fox (1625-1691) did not find answers to his questions in any of the churches of his day. Out of his searching came the spiritual message which swept a large part of the country and which resulted in the formation of the Religious Society of Friends.

Friends witnessed to an Alternative Christianity quite distinct from the churches of the time. As a result they were persecuted both by Cromwell's Puritan government and by the restored government of Charles II. Fox did not intend to start a new sect. He wanted to persuade the church to return to what it had been in the days of the Apostles. He proclaimed the early preaching of Peter (Acts, chapter 2 and 3) that Jesus, who had been present in the flesh, had risen from the dead and was now come in the Spirit. That Jesus acted in the hearts of his followers purifying and empowering them.

Pursuing Peter's teaching, Fox called for a radical, egalitarian, spirit-filled Christianity that would not be oppressive of people on account of race, sex, or class. He maintained that the message of the early church had been lost when the church became institutionalized and believed that he, and others with him, could stand in exactly the same state as Apostles, with the same power to teach, to heal, and to prophesy that the Apostles had.


THE MINISTRY OF ALL BELIEVERS

George Fox challenged the belief of the Roman Catholic and Episcopal churches in the necessity for, and the authority of, a hierarchical structure of Priests and Bishops. He claimed that everyone was able to have a personal relationship with the living Jesus without having to depend on the intercessions of a Priest or Minister. He taught that there is one, Jesus Christ, who can speak to each person's condition and the responsibility for ministry therefore rested upon all.


THE PLACE OF THE BIBLE

Friends hold that the words of the Bible should not be taken as the final revelation of God. The Books had been written by men who were acting under the power of the Holy Spirit and it was necessary to read the words in the power of the same spirit and to listen to what the Spirit then spoke in your heart. The words were active agents in the sense that, when read in the Spirit at the appropriate time, they would spring to life for the reader and take the reader forward on his or her spiritual journey.
 
THE LIGHT WITHIN

George Fox preached the Good News that we were all children of God and that, as children of God, we had inherited powers from God. Each of us was given a measure of this power or light and in accordance with how we used it, so more would be given to us. Jesus had possessed this power or light, without measure so that he became the Light and the Light within is Jesus Christ.


THE INNER VOICE

Friends believe that if they wait silently upon God there will be times when God will speak to them in the heart. The silent Meeting of Friends is therefore the sacrament of communion with God during which Friends lay themselves open to the leading of the Spirit. George Fox often wrote about his ``openings'', meaning revelations and it has been the experience of Quakers over the centuries that ``openings'' will occur in the mind of that ``a way will open''.

Openings can come to individuals when they are alone or may come out of the silence of a gathered Meeting for Worship. It is a perennial question as to whether a leading comes from God, from one's own ego, or from another power and it is the practice in the Society of Friends to test a leading or a concern in a meeting with others.

When they meet for business Friends strive to obtain the ``sense of the meeting'' from those present before taking action for they recognize the light as a force which creates unity among all who respond to it or who
``answer it in one another''. It does not follow that a majority is always right; a prophetic role is a lonely one
and, if a concern is deeply felt and continues to be raised, the Meeting will continue to hear it and may later come to recognize its validity.


EQUALITY BEFORE GOD

From the beginning Friends gave women and men equal status, for the fact that we are all children of God bestowed an equality upon all. This concept led to the testimony that one person should not set himself above others through human honors and distinctions which were meaningless in the sight of God. From this came the Quaker practices of simple living, plain dress and plain speech.


THE INWARD AND OUTWARD JOURNEYS

One of the most important messages that Quakers have to offer is that religion, or belief, is experiential. It is not just a matter of accepting words or practices but of experiencing God for oneself.

The fact that God is always present means that the whole of a person's life is sacramental; Friends affirm the need to practice the presence of God in all activity. It follows, therefore, that Friends emphasize the importance of combining the inward and outward journeys. To take the inward without the outward will lead to selfishness. You go inward to wait upon and receive the word and support of God and then take this out to action in the world. To take the outward journey without the inward leads to ``burn out'' because the essential support is not there to be called upon. The Inward/Outward Journey is the practical application of Jesus' summary of the Law: ``Love God and your neighbor as yourself.''

It is the inward/outward process that has led Friends into pioneering social action such as reforms of prisons, schools and mental institutions, improving conditions of employment, supporting refugees and others in need, providing an ambulance service in wartime and examining the consequences of proposed legislation.
 
THE PEACE TESTIMONY

As a Peace Church, the Society of Friends has always played a leading part in opposing preparations for war. The Peace Testimony, which is a very important Quaker principle, arose out of the belief in the in-dwelling Light or ``that of God'' in people. If that of God was a reality within oneself it would be denying the inner Spirit to take up arms against another.

Quaker practice does not permit the overcoming of some persons by other persons but tends toward the integration of various points of view into a new and higher level, for they recognize the Light as a force which creates unity amongst all who respond to it or answer it in one another. In appealing to the Light within another we also appeal to the Light within ourselves; as a result, we may find that the other is right and we are wrong. The Light is a source of unity. Force may create a superficial unity but it cannot provide organic unity.


QUAKER PRACTICES

Over the years the practice of Quakerism has developed in different ways in different regions. Members of the Society have been affected by varying influences such as the greater awareness of Eastern religions, the growth of psychology and the development of scientific knowledge. Since the Society is non-creedal, the spectrum of belief held by Friends has widened and different opinions may be held in different places or cultures. When one considers the diversity in other denominations, the differences between Friends are less remarkable. Friends Meetings may be either unprogrammed or programmed, the latter normally being led by a pastor.


FRIENDS AND OTHER FAITHS

Quakers have always taught that the Light of Christ has been given to all people everywhere. They maintained that many persons who never heard the historic Christ have had experiential knowledge of the Christ within and would hold, with Paul, that the Eternal Christ was known before the historic Christ. However, Friends are prepared to receive insights from wheresoever they may come and agree that there are things to be learned from contact with other religions. Friends are therefore ready to dialogue with people of other faiths and to share with them insights from our respective inheritances. However, Quakerism remains rooted in the Christian faith and the centrality of Jesus is paramount, although his sovereignty is not unanimously upheld.


SUMMARY

The Religious Society of Friends is an Alternative Christianity which emphasizes the personal experience of God in one's life. Quakers understand the necessity of first listening to God before working in the world. They affirm the equality of all people before God regardless of race, station in life, or sex and this belief leads them into a range of social concerns.

Being "Children of Light" they find recourse to violence intolerable. Quaker thought is both mystical (waiting upon God) and prophetic (speaking truth to power). Friends believe that God's revelation is still continuing, that God is not absent or unknowable but that we can find God ourselves and establish a living relationship thus being able to live in the world free from the burden and guilt of sin. It is the search for a closer relationship with God that is the Way.

Religious knowledge, like the appreciation of beauty, is not attained by a logical process of thought but by experience and feeling. Quakers maintain that the teaching of Jesus is a practical method for the guidance of the world today, that religion is concerned with the whole of life, and that, beyond a certain point, definition becomes a limitation.
 

I feel the best way to give you information about the “Mormon” church that Howard joined is to quote the Articles of Faith, which should give you an idea of the origin and beliefs of that religion.
